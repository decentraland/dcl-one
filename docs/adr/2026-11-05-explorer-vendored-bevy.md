# ADR: The Explorer's Bevy is vendored in this repository

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-11-05

## Context

The Bevy Explorer built every Bevy crate over git from `robtfm/bevy`, branch `release-0.16-dcl`,
locked at `dac1ac9`: upstream `v0.16.1` plus 102 commits (+7,848/−1,336 lines in 180 files), all
of them explorer changes (`rendering/bevy-explorer/docs/guidelines/bevy-fork.md`). A Bevy change
shipped as a push to that branch, which only its owner could make, plus a lockfile bump PR here.

The next explorer changes are in Bevy itself: glTF instances that spawn a slice of their nodes per
frame need a resumable writer in `bevy_scene`'s spawner. Every such change would take two
repositories, two reviews and a lockfile bump, and the fork's history would stay apart from the
code that depends on it.

## Decision

Vendor the fork at `rendering/bevy-explorer/bevy`, one import of the tree at `dac1ac9`, and change
it in place from now on. This repository is the source of truth; the fork branch stays frozen.

- **What is imported:** the whole tree except `assets/` (358 files, 55 MB of example assets, which
  Bevy's own crates.io package leaves out too), the symlink `examples/wasm/assets` into it, and
  the fork's `.gitattributes`, whose `* text=auto` would override the root's `-text` rule for the
  subtree. Every other file is the fork's blob, byte for byte. Bevy's own workspace stays
  loadable, so its crates' tests can run in it.
- **Where:** beside `source/`, outside the Explorer's Cargo workspace. It is no workspace member,
  needs no `exclude`, and the Explorer's Clippy, Rustfmt and Taplo gates do not reach it.
  `rust-cache` keeps its artifacts, since they lie outside the workspace root.
- **Cargo:** `[patch.crates-io]` maps the 18 Bevy crates that ecosystem crates name by version to
  paths in the tree, and `[patch."https://github.com/robtfm/bevy"]` maps `bevy` for `bevy_dui`,
  `bevy_ecss` and `boimp`, which name the fork by git. `Cargo.lock` changes only by the 47 Bevy
  packages losing their git source.
- **Warnings:** a path dependency's rustc warnings are not capped, as a git dependency's are. The
  vendored root `Cargo.toml` allows `dead_code` (code our feature set leaves unused) and
  `mismatched_lifetime_syntaxes` (a lint newer than Bevy 0.16), with a comment saying why. They
  made up 810 of the 835 warnings Bevy's 47 crates printed in a native workspace check; the
  complete check afterwards prints 30, from six other lints. This is the only change to the fork's
  files.
- **Tooling:** the paths that keyed on `source/` also cover the tree: `.gitattributes`,
  `tooling/bevy-ci.py` (a Bevy change selects every lane, the Windows and macOS matrix included),
  `tooling/play-artifact.py` and `infra/packages/play.nix` (Bevy is a web engine input), and
  `tooling/ci-local.py`. `forks.toml` and `cargo-patches.toml` no longer list Bevy, since the lock
  has no Bevy git source.
- **Changes after the move:** an ordinary PR under `rendering/bevy-explorer/bevy`, updating
  `bevy-fork.md` in the same PR. Upstream fixes are backported with
  `git format-patch | git apply -3 --directory=rendering/bevy-explorer/bevy`, naming the upstream
  PR.

## Rejected options

- **Subtree with history:** imports Bevy's 8,842-commit history, and this repository merges by
  squash only, which flattens it anyway.
- **The fork's 102 commits replayed on a pristine 0.16.1 import:** the same squash problem.
- **Upstream 0.16.1 plus patch files** (the earlier dcl-one engine kept 27): the patches must be
  applied before Cargo can resolve, and a Bevy change becomes an edit to a patch file.
- **`rendering/bevy-explorer/source/vendor/bevy`:** the `source/` tooling would cover it
  unchanged, but it needs a workspace `exclude` and a Taplo exclusion, `play-artifact.py` rejects
  its symlink, a Bevy change would count as platform-neutral source, and `rust-cache` would drop
  its artifacts.
- **The whole tree with `assets/`:** 55 MB no build or test reads, two thirds of the repository's
  size.
- **The fork kept upstream and re-imported:** two sources of truth, and every change made here
  would conflict with the next import.
- **A `cargo vendor` directory source:** fingerprinted by version, so local edits would not
  rebuild.

## Verification

- `git diff --name-status dac1ac9^{tree} <import commit>:rendering/bevy-explorer/bevy` lists only
  the 360 omitted entries; `git ls-files --eol rendering/bevy-explorer/bevy` shows `-text`, with
  the same endings in the index and the working tree.
- The resolved graph (crates, versions, enabled features, edges and dependency kinds) is identical
  before and after, for every platform (1,332 packages) and for `wasm32-unknown-unknown` (1,030),
  with the same 44 workspace members; `cargo metadata --locked` accepts the lock.
- With the lock, a cargo home holding every other source but not the fork's resolves offline; the
  same home fails on a checkout that still uses the git fork.
- `cargo clippy --locked -- -D warnings` passes: a path dependency outside the workspace is built
  by plain rustc, so Clippy's lints never run on Bevy.
- The tooling tests pin the new inputs: `test_vendored_bevy_selects_every_lane_and_the_native_matrix`,
  `test_vendored_bevy_rebuilds_the_images`, `test_vendored_bevy_edits_invalidate_the_artifact`,
  `test_vendored_bevy_is_an_engine_input_in_git_and_in_the_nix_contract`.

Binaries are not bit-identical: Bevy's absolute source path changes inside `file!()`, panic
locations and debug info. `embedded_asset!` paths do not change, since they are taken from the
nearest `src` directory.

## Consequences

- Bevy changes are reviewed and merged here, with the code that uses them.
- Bevy now recompiles in every native CI job: Cargo checks a path dependency's freshness by file
  times, and a fresh checkout is always newer than the cache. The web engine rebuilds exactly
  when Bevy or the Explorer changes.
- The fork branch must stay fetchable while `bevy_dui`, `bevy_ecss` and `boimp` name it: a
  resolve without `Cargo.lock` reads it once.
- The drift site no longer tracks Bevy against upstream; an upgrade is a planned project, and its
  delta is `git diff v0.16.1^{tree} HEAD:rendering/bevy-explorer/bevy`.
