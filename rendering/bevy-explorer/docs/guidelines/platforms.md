# Platforms

The engine builds three ways from one workspace. The architecture diagrams show where each
piece runs; this page is the list of things that differ and bite.

| | Native | Web | Headless |
|---|---|---|---|
| Binary | `decentra-bevy`, plus the `dcl_deno_ipc` sidecar and the `decentra-bevy-cef` helper | wasm in the engine worker, loaded by `deploy/web/engine/` | `headless`, behind the `headless` feature |
| Scenes run in | V8 isolates in the sidecar | one sandbox worker per scene | V8 isolates in the sidecar |
| HUD | react-web rendered by CEF into an engine texture | react-web as DOM over the canvas | none |
| Rendering | wgpu | WebGPU in a render worker, Chrome only | none |

## Keep the boundary clean

Make as much code platform-independent as possible, behind a clean boundary. Generic backend
functions go in the `platform` crate, which has one `native` and one `wasm` implementation of
the same signatures: `fetch`, `websocket`, config and scene-file IO, pointer lock, the async
lock, the default camera bundle. Code that needs one of those calls `platform::x` and never
sees a `cfg`. Backend functionality that only one caller needs lives next to that caller
(the livekit bridge in `comms`, the page-event dispatch), behind a `cfg` there, not in
`platform`. Either way the platform-specific part is a leaf; the logic that uses it is shared.

## Web

- **Chrome only.** Design against Chrome's feature set (multi-memory, JSPI, `Atomics.waitAsync`)
  and do not add cross-browser hedges.
- **No threads as you know them.** `TaskPool::spawn` runs on the JS event loop: no `Send`,
  no blocking, no `std::thread`, no busy-waiting. Use `web_time` for clocks. The engine worker
  runs the app world; the render world lives in its own worker.
- **The log level is compiled in.** `RUST_LOG` does nothing at runtime on wasm. A debug log you
  want to see needs a rebuild with the filter changed.
- **Engine switches are page params, not launch options.** A web-only knob is a `?param=` the
  page reads and hands to a wasm export, like `?guest=`. Adding it to `LaunchOptions` pollutes
  the native `--help` for something native can't use.
- **Derivatives in uniform control flow.** `dpdx`, `dpdy`, `fwidth` and `textureSample` inside
  a non-uniform `if` fail on web only. Hoist them above the branch.
- **Custom transparent materials must write the focus target.** The fork's transparent pass
  has a second output at `@location(1)` (`TRANSPARENT_FOCUS_OUTPUT`). A fragment shader that
  omits it fails pipeline creation on web and is silent on native.
- **16-bit textures lose precision** through the web sampler. Expect banding if you rely on it.
- **Build.** `just wasm` in `source` builds the wasm package and the sandbox worker bundle and
  starts the page dev server and the bridge. If a stale dev server is already on the port it
  gets reused; kill it first. The distributable is `make web` from repository-root
  `apps/bevy-explorer`, which builds the wasm package, sandbox worker and HUD into `dist/web`
  without serving them (see [Running](running.md#web)). `just wasm` also runs from Git Bash on
  Windows: a wasm build there gets `file!()` paths with backslashes, which the fork's
  `embedded_asset!` normalizes. Use Git Bash for every `just` recipe there: from PowerShell
  `just` finds no `sh`, and the `bash` on its `PATH` is usually WSL's. Windows has no `make`:
  `make web` is `python build-web.py` (`--no-opt` for `web-dev`), from any shell.
- **Exit work runs before `Last`.** On `AppExit`, `close_rooms_on_app_exit` blocks in `Last`
  (`comms`), so on web a system in `Last` may never run again. Anything that must reach the page
  at exit, such as the benchmark stream's final bytes, runs in `Update`.
- **The content cache is capped.** Downloaded content lives in the Cache API cache
  `ipfs-path-cache-v2` (`crates/ipfs/src/web_cache.rs`), at most 1 GiB or the configured
  `cache_bytes` if lower, and at most half the origin's quota. The service worker trims it,
  oldest-written entries first, down to 90% of the cap, when the engine asks through the
  `__contentCacheTrim` page function (`deploy/web/engine/content_cache.js`): at start, after each
  sixteenth of the cap written (at most 64 MiB), and before retrying a write that failed for quota
  (then it frees the oldest content worth a quarter of the cap, sizing no more, at most once a
  minute). It never opens another cache. The cap applies to the content cache's own bytes: Cache
  Storage usage (`usageDetails.caches`, or the origin's whole usage where the browser does not
  report it) only bounds them, so at or under the cap nothing is enumerated, and over it every
  entry is sized and that total alone decides what goes. A page no service worker controls (after
  a hard reload) is not trimmed: it logs that once, and asks again if a worker takes control
  later (a worker update; a hard-reloaded page stays uncontrolled until the next load). The page
  asks once for persistent storage. The **Web Content Cache** debug section shows the readings;
  in preview mode it can override the cap for the session (at least 1 MiB). The scene server's
  frame runs a second engine that asks for its own configured cap, so an override above that
  lasts only until its next trim.
- **Two GPUs: Chrome takes the low-power one.** On a laptop with integrated and discrete GPUs,
  Chrome's WebGPU renders on the integrated one while native wgpu takes the discrete one: on one
  laptop the same web build ran much slower (measurements (evidence supplied for the task)).
  Start Chrome with `--force-high-performance-gpu` to compare with native (the benchmark's browser
  leg does).
- **Rollout.** The web build ships to zone and org by a percentage walk; publishing any branch
  moves zone. Ask before publishing.

## Native

- Build and run with `just native-debug` or `just native-release`, with the client's own
  arguments after them (`--realm <url> --position x,y`). Both bundle the HUD when it is stale.
  A bare `cargo run` gives a login screen with no HUD because the bundle isn't built. Both
  binaries build: `cargo build --package dcl_deno_ipc` then `cargo build`. `just setup-cef`
  fetches the CEF framework once; only macOS falls back to it at runtime, so the `just` loop is
  macOS-first (see [Running](running.md#native) for Linux and Windows). Packaging follows the
  [native build steps](running.md#native).
- **Task pools.** Compute, which runs both worlds' parallel systems and `par_iter` work, gets
  half the cores (2 to 8; `--compute-threads` overrides it). IO is fixed at 8 because bevy runs
  every asset loader's decode there; async takes a quarter of the cores (2 to 8). The pools add
  up to more than the core count, so a heavy load shares cores with the frame's systems.
- **GPU uploads.** Throttled asset uploads are capped at 10 MB per frame, as on the web
  (`--gpu-bytes-per-frame`, 0 = unlimited). Assets with `RenderAssetTransferPriority::Immediate`,
  which includes every mesh, bypass the cap.
- **CEF `localStorage` is ephemeral.** Anything the native HUD must remember goes through
  `lib/prefs`, which the engine persists to disk. No native popups from the HUD: CEF's popup
  windows aren't composited into the texture.
- **Windows paths.** `Path::is_absolute` is not a containment check there; see the security
  page.
- **Windows builds.** v8's build script symlinks its source into the target dir when the two sit
  on different drives, and Windows refuses without Developer Mode: keep `CARGO_HOME` and
  `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` on one drive. `cef-dll-sys` needs Ninja on `PATH`; Visual Studio ships one
  under `Common7\IDE\CommonExtensions\Microsoft\CMake\Ninja`. A cold build at a high job count can
  run LLVM out of memory: limit it with `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS`, and keep tens of gigabytes free for a
  debug target dir (measurements (evidence supplied for the task)). Keep `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` short
  and free of spaces: under a worktree's `.../source/target`, LiveKit's prebuilt libwebrtc headers
  pass the 260-character path limit and `webrtc-sys` stops with C1083 on an `absl/...` header, and
  GN-style build scripts break on a space. protoc is the `protoc-<version>-win64.zip` release that
  `apps/bevy-explorer/install-protoc.py` pins (that script only runs on CI): put its `bin` on
  `PATH` or set `PROTOC`. `CEF_PATH` takes a Windows path; in Git Bash,
  `export CEF_PATH="$(cygpath -w ~/.local/share/cef)"` after `just setup-cef`.
- **A PR runs the Windows and macOS tests only for platform inputs.** A Rust change under
  `rendering/bevy-explorer/source` runs clippy, the native test suite on Linux, the headless smoke
  test and the web build (`tooling/bevy-ci.py` at the dcl-one root selects them). The suite adds
  Windows and macOS when the PR changes the root `Cargo.toml`, a `build*.rs`, `.cargo`, the
  toolchain, `local-harness/benchmark`, `local-harness/web-driver`, a file or folder named
  `windows` or `macos`, the locked package set in `Cargo.lock`, or a CI input outside the engine
  source (the workflow, the selector, `library/vendor/rusty_enet`, `apps/bevy-explorer` build
  scripts); when it is labelled `ci:macos` (then push or reopen); and on every main push and
  manual run that runs the suite. Label a PR whose change is platform-specific, or the break shows
  up on `main`: a `cfg(target_os)` block, or a crate `Cargo.toml` that adds a
  `[target.'cfg(...)'.dependencies]` entry on a crate already in `Cargo.lock`, runs on Linux only.

## Memory budgets

`MemoryStatus` samples engine-process RSS in native rendering and headless clients, and live
shared engine-heap allocations on Web, at most four times a second. `GpuMemoryBudget`
independently samples the renderer's selected native adapter or device
at most once a second. Each pool carries used bytes and a positive budget. Usage can exceed the budget.

| Renderer | GPU reading |
|---|---|
| Windows DX12 | Current process usage and the OS budget for the local segment on the renderer's node. [DXGI fields](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/dxgi1_4/ns-dxgi1_4-dxgi_query_video_memory_info) |
| Windows or Linux Vulkan | Estimated process usage for each device-local heap with a usable driver budget. Each heap has its own limit. Requires `VK_EXT_memory_budget`. [Vulkan memory budgets](https://docs.vulkan.org/refpages/latest/refpages/source/VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryBudgetPropertiesEXT.html) |
| macOS Metal | Allocated resource bytes and the device's recommended working set, including on unified-memory devices. If the renderer holds the device lock, the previous reading stays visible and sampling retries the next frame. [Metal working set](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtldevice/recommendedmaxworkingsetsize) |
| Browser WebGPU or renderless headless | `NotApplicable`. WebGPU exposes no driver memory budget. [WebGPU adapter interface](https://www.w3.org/TR/webgpu/#gpuadapter) |
| Native query unsupported, failed or pending | `Unavailable`. A consumer has no current reading for this adapter. |

### Using the budgets in future asset loaders

Estimate the **additional peak bytes** of the operation in each domain, including concurrent
uploads and any old allocation still in use during replacement. Backing allocations determine
which budget applies. A scene, avatar or glTF can contain several of the following.

| Asset | RAM cost | GPU cost and possible response |
|---|---|---|
| Textures and video frames | Decode and upload staging, plus any retained pixels | Count blocks in the uploaded format at each mip, including layers or 3D depth and samples. A smaller texture or shorter buffered video queue can reduce the peak. |
| Meshes | CPU vertices, indices, colliders and staging | Charge growth of backing vertex/index buffers. Meshes sharing a slab reuse its allocation. A lower LOD can avoid growing it. |
| Audio and scene data | Decoded PCM, scene state and CPU caches | Consult RAM for CPU-only assets. A texture visualizing audio has its own GPU cost. |
| Render targets, shadow maps and imposters | Any separately retained CPU copy | Count each color, depth, multisample and resolve allocation once. A smaller target, shadow map or sample count lowers the GPU cost. |

Track shared allocations by backing identity through release. Views, handles and multiple users
of the same resource do not add another copy. Compare an estimate with its eligible native pool;
separate Vulkan heaps cannot lend each other space. On unified memory, RAM and GPU readings can
cover the same pages, so adding them would double-count. When the driver reading is absent, Web
can still track estimates against an explicit quality-profile allowance and handle allocation
failure by reducing quality. That allowance should remain distinguishable from measured headroom.

## GPU timestamps

The benchmark's GPU time (`gpu/frame_time`, see [GPU time](benchmark.md#gpu-time)) is the
difference of two timestamps that empty compute passes write with `timestamp_writes`, which needs
`wgpu::Features::TIMESTAMP_QUERY` on the render device. The engine sets no `WgpuSettings` of its
own (the web render worker uses the default too), so Bevy's default `Functionality` priority
requests every feature the adapter reports, and the feature is on wherever the backend exposes
it. Without it the engine logs one info line under `gpu_time` and has no GPU time. In the fork's
wgpu (`robtfm/wgpu` `e25f3d4`, 24.0.5):

| Backend | `TIMESTAMP_QUERY` | Tick period | Checked on hardware |
|---|---|---|---|
| DX12 (Windows) | always | the queue's timestamp frequency | Windows, RTX 5080 Laptop GPU: the GPU tests, and the packaged release standalone with FXC and `--no_gltf` |
| Vulkan (Windows, Linux) | always | the device's `timestampPeriod` limit | Windows, the same GPU: the GPU tests and the packaged release standalone, which picks Vulkan by itself; Linux not |
| Metal (macOS) | when the device samples counters at stage boundaries (macOS 11 or newer) | fixed: 1 ns, 83.333 ns when the device name starts with "Intel" | not checked |
| WebGPU (Chrome) | when the browser's adapter lists `timestamp-query` | 1 ns (WebGPU reports nanoseconds) | Chrome on Windows (RTX 5080 Laptop GPU) |

- **DX12 and Vulkan** set the feature for every device: `wgpu-hal/src/dx12/adapter.rs` lists it
  among the features "always available on d3d12", and `wgpu-hal/src/vulkan/adapter.rs` sets it
  without reading the queue's timestamp bits.
- **DX12 in the packaged Windows folder** does not reach a frame, with the GPU time off too. The
  folder holds CEF's `dxcompiler.dll` and `dxil.dll`, and Bevy picks the DXC shader compiler
  whenever both sit in the working directory (`bevy_render/src/settings.rs`); wgpu's own
  indirect-validation pipeline then fails (`Validator version in metadata (1.9) is not supported;
  maximum: (1.7)`) and the device is lost at creation. `WGPU_DX12_COMPILER=fxc` starts it, and
  the full scene then runs out of descriptors (`Unable to allocate descriptors`); `--no_gltf`
  keeps the scene small enough to run. Vulkan, which wgpu picks by itself on the RTX 5080 laptop,
  is unaffected.
- **Metal.** A compute pass's `timestamp_writes` become the encoder's start and end samples
  (`wgpu-hal/src/metal/command.rs`), which stage-boundary sampling covers
  (`wgpu-hal/src/metal/adapter.rs`). Whether an empty pass writes its samples is not checked.
  wgpu does not convert Metal's GPU timestamps to CPU time; it hard-codes the period, and its own
  comment names Apple silicon (M1, M2) and AMD for the 1 ns. Not checked here.
- **WebGPU.** `wgpu/src/backend/webgpu.rs` maps the feature to `timestamp-query` and passes the
  pass `timestampWrites` through.
- **Chrome quantises timestamps** unless its "WebGPU Developer Features" flag is on
  (`chrome://flags/#enable-webgpu-developer-features`;
  [Chrome's WebGPU 121 notes](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/new-in-webgpu-121) give 100 µs).
  The benchmark runner does not set it. In the checked Chrome every web GPU value is a multiple of
  65.536 µs (measurements (evidence supplied for the task)). That is Chrome's behaviour, not wgpu's.
- **Headless** has no render app, so it has no GPU time.

## Headless

- The headless binary is the production authoritative scene server and the local preview
  server. It runs the same `ScenePlugin` and scene loop with a narrower plugin set and no
  render app. `source/docs/headless-sdk-preview.md` and `source/docs/PRESENCE_ISOLATION.md`
  cover the server-side contracts. Resolve scene-response isolation proposals
  and their review status through authorized task context; proposals require
  a user verdict before implementation.
- **It is feature-gated.** `--bin headless --no-default-features --features headless,livekit`. Running the wrong bin through a
  pipe exits 0 and tells you nothing.
- **Missing resources only show at runtime.** The headless plugin set skips `InputManagerPlugin`
  among others, so a system that takes a `Res<>` from a skipped plugin compiles and panics on
  first run. Run the headless binary against a scene before pushing anything that touches
  shared systems.
- Every scene-facing capability needs the headless question answered: see the security page.
