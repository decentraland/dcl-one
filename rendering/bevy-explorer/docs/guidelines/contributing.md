Smaller PRs are better. Everything below is in service of that and of a reviewer who can
understand the change in one sitting.

## Scope

- One problem per PR, fixed at the sentence that names it. If the fix wants new state or
  plumbing the problem didn't mention, that is a second PR and a conversation first. Give
  independently useful diagnostics their own PR and verification.
- Anything that changes an interface between areas, adds a scene-facing capability, or will
  take more than a couple of days gets a short written plan before a branch exists. The
  approach, not prose.
- For multi-step features, get the whole pipeline working as a proof of concept first, then
  split it into reviewable PRs. Intermediate states that build but cannot be exercised are not
  reviewable.
- We squash-merge, so stacked PRs conflict on the child after the base lands. Prefer
  sequential small PRs over stacks.

## The diff

- Nothing in the diff the change doesn't require. No reordering, restyling, renaming locals or
  tidying neighbours. Reviewer load beats marginal tidiness.
- Comments say what the code cannot: a current constraint, a non-obvious invariant, a platform
  quirk. Not what the code does, and no archaeological commentary: not what the old design was,
  not why the new one doesn't need X, not an argument addressed to the reviewer. Strip those
  before pushing. Rationale goes in the PR description.
- When simplifying a feature, remove leftover edits that no longer change behaviour. Keep
  comments that explain constraints still in force and rename tests that now prove a different
  contract.
- Limit each `Drop` implementation to one blocking operation. Release a lock before taking
  another or doing file I/O. Put multi-step cleanup in an explicit completion path.
- Reuse what exists: protocol and SDK types, the existing scheduling, picking and loading
  paths. Hand-rolled parallels are the main source of drift.
- You should not need to add a schedule set or ordering step. If you think you do, raise it
  first; the [scheduling guide](scheduling.md) explains the current setup.
- If something works better with a change in a dependency, change the dependency. Upstream it
  where possible; where it is bespoke to us, we maintain our forks for exactly that. See
  [the bevy fork](bevy-fork.md).

## Tests

- Test behaviour at a boundary, not the shape of the implementation. A test that has to change
  when the code is refactored without a behaviour change is a cost, not an asset.
- For route and service contracts, exercise the actual producers and consumers, such as the
  engine resolver, the HUD resolver and generated proxy configuration. Assert which endpoints
  they share and which intentionally use separate destinations.
- Pair a network access denial with a permitted case through the same transport. Check what
  the server actually received so a client-side error cannot hide an unwanted request.
- For each required regression, identify the CI job and command that execute it. Verify that
  selectors include the test, including any explicit opt-in, and that the job has the tools
  and files the test needs. Check path filters against changes to the test's inputs, including
  routing sources outside the engine workspace.
- Parse structured output; never string-compare it. Serialisation order is not stable across
  feature unification.
- For anything animated or staged, test what lands mid-way, not only the happy path. Enumerate
  the events that can arrive while the transition runs: the thing it replaces is rebuilt,
  despawned, hidden, or toggled by its setting, or it loads late or fails. Decide the behaviour
  for each and give each a test.

## The PR description is the record

- Squash-merge discards commit bodies. The description carries the why, the alternatives
  rejected, and how it was verified, naming the platforms covered: native, web, headless.
  For network capabilities, describe the caller, transport, platform and mode that grant
  access. For instrumentation, identify the request paths that emit events and which
  callers bypass them, then verify the documented event lifecycle.
- A diagram for anything with dataflow, ordering or lifetime changes. A draw.io SVG or a
  mermaid block both render on GitHub. A reviewer reads a diagram in a minute and a 400-line
  diff in an hour.
- Screenshots before and after for rendering changes. There is no visual regression suite for
  the 3D side.
- A port from Unity names the Unity files it follows, the constants carried over, and every
  divergence with its reason. See [porting from Unity](porting-from-unity.md).
- Follow the repository PR template, including its test instructions and checks run; omit a chronological work narrative.

## Before pushing

- Merge main first. CI tests the merge, not the branch.
- `cargo fmt --all`, `cargo clippy --locked -- -D warnings`, `cargo test --all`. Clippy warnings
  are errors in CI.
- The wasm build, only if the change has platform-sensitive code: `#[cfg]` branches,
  threading, atomics, blocking calls, timers, filesystem or network access, wasm-specific deps.
- Web-only engine switches are a page param plus a wasm export, not a launch option.

## Dependencies

- **Never run `cargo update`. Edit `Cargo.lock` by hand.** Cargo's re-resolve is not
  deterministic for this workspace: any `cargo update -p <crate>`, and any dependabot rebase,
  also flips unrelated lines (`syn` 2 to 1 under `data-encoding-macro-internal`, `heck` 0.5 to
  0.4 under `prost-build`, and others). Those flips are rejected in review even when CI is
  green. To bump a dependency, change its `version`, `source` or git hash, `checksum` and
  dependency list in the lock directly, then validate with `cargo metadata --locked` (exit 0
  means the lock was accepted unchanged). For a dependabot PR, take main's lock and hand-apply
  only the intended crate's change.
- Hoist every third-party dependency to `[workspace.dependencies]` and use
  `{ workspace = true }` at the call site, even for a crate used in one place. Convert existing
  inline uses of the same crate in the same change.
- Changes to bevy go in [the fork](bevy-fork.md); that page covers patching it locally.
- `rendering/bevy-explorer/forks.toml` and `cargo-patches.toml` are generated from the lock.
  After changing a git dependency's revision, run `python3 tooling/upstream-forks.py` from the
  dcl-one root so they match; a daily workflow otherwise opens an `upstream/forks` PR.

## Review

- First response within one working day. If it hasn't come, ping the reviewer on Slack rather
  than wait.

### Reviewing content request changes

From the repository root, run `python tooling/bevy-http-checks.py` with the native build
prerequisites. It runs the IPFS and platform libraries' tests in parallel and compiles
`scene_inspector`, `imposters` and `scene_runner`. Those consumers exercise the editor
import, imposter and font-loading interfaces. A missing or unexecuted required regression
fails the check. For a targeted run, `--filter TEXT` selects matching tests and
`--tests-only` skips consumer compilation. [Build prerequisites](running.md)

| Check | Regression |
|---|---|
| One network attempt consumes one ticket and holds the permit through the body read | `a_content_fetch_uses_exactly_one_ticket_on_its_own_gate`, `engine_request_keeps_its_slot_until_the_body_finishes` |
| Other downloads can run during backoff and the retry queues again under the current priorities | `retry_uses_live_priorities_after_another_download_completes_in_backoff`, `immediate_timeout_retry_yields_to_an_older_unowned_request` |
| Equal-priority arrivals preserve their order even when the executor polls them in reverse | `shared_downloads_keep_arrival_order_when_workers_poll_in_reverse` |
| Dropping a reader preserves other claims and dropping the last one cancels queue waits and retry timers | `dropping_shared_readers_withdraws_only_the_last_claim_of_each_owner`, `last_shared_reader_cancels_a_queued_attempt_and_a_retry_timer` |
| Concurrent writers publish complete cache files, preserve occupied staging files, and remove their own staging file after a failed publish | `concurrent_writes_to_one_cache_key_publish_complete_files`, `cache_writer_skips_a_stale_staging_file`, `failed_cache_publish_removes_its_staging_file` |
| Readiness polls obey server delays and their deadline | `readiness_poll_respects_retry_after_and_remaining_deadline` |
| Keys are published while a slot is in use, since its release can choose between newcomers | `keys_are_read_while_a_slot_is_in_use` |
| A departed hash ranks last while any request of it is alive, including a retry after its queue drained | `a_departed_hash_ranks_last_for_a_retry_after_its_queue_drained` |
| The gate keeps granting after a poisoned lock, and a release skips a queue entry without its ticket instead of panicking in a destructor | `a_poisoned_gate_keeps_granting_and_releasing`, `a_queue_entry_without_its_ticket_is_skipped_inside_a_release` |

Give each test its own gate and counters so it can run alongside other tests. Trace destructor
paths for nested locks or file I/O under a lock. When changing diagnostics, check the units
and width of each counter against partial transfers and overlapping requests.

Before adding a shared budget, identify the workload that needs it and measure the impact
on unrelated callers. Give changes with independent consumers or failure modes their own
PR and test evidence.

For browser forwarding changes, run
`npx vitest run src/test/serviceWorkerCache.test.ts src/test/previewRealm.test.ts` from
`rendering/bevy-explorer/source/react-web`. Check abort propagation, streamed requests,
referrer policy and disposal of unread response bodies.
