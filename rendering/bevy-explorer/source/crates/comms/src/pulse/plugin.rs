//! Pulse Bevy plugin — the shared, platform-agnostic protocol layer.
//!
//! Owns the [`PulseDecoder`] and the driver lifecycle, and pumps the byte boundary: inbound
//! `ServerMessage` bytes are decoded and dispatched; outbound `ClientMessage`s (handshake, teleport,
//! resync today; input later) are encoded onto the driver. The driver itself (native thread / wasm
//! task) is selected at compile time and never seen here.
//!
//! Connect sequence, mirroring the Unity reference client: once the driver reports
//! [`PulseStatus::Connected`] we send a [`pulse::HandshakeRequest`] (a signed auth chain, identical
//! in shape to the platform's `x-identity-*` header dictionary but delivered as protobuf bytes,
//! with the player's last state as its initial state once built); on the server's
//! `HandshakeResponse` we send the first gameplay message, a [`pulse::TeleportRequest`] announcing
//! our realm + position so the server starts streaming same-realm peers — unless the initial state
//! already carried this realm — and then the profile version, which the servers ignore in the
//! handshake. Teleports and emotes leave through a [`DiscreteEventPacer`]: the servers end the
//! session of a peer that overruns the budget they share.
//!
//! Reconnection model: a driver runs exactly one connection attempt and, when that attempt ends,
//! drops its channel ends. Its last status (the server's `Disconnected(reason)`, or a failure of its
//! own), or failing that the pipe close, says the transport is gone; the protocol layer also closes
//! a connection itself when its one handshake fails. Either way it rebuilds the whole driver/link
//! from `Down` when the [`ReconnectPolicy`] says, or parks in `Dead` for a terminal reason. Initial
//! connect is just the first such build.
