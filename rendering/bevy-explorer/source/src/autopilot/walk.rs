//! `--autopilot-walk-to`: a benchmark run that walks in instead of standing at spawn. Once
//! measuring starts, the player moves in a straight line from where it arrived to the centre of
//! the given parcel at [`WALK_SPEED`], facing it, then stands there for the rest of the run. The
//! scenes on the way load during play: walking never raises the loading backdrop (only a teleport
//! or a realm change does), so their instantiation lands in the measured frames.
//!
//! The walk sets the player's position on the ground plane each frame, after the movement systems
//! and before the camera follows; the physics keeps the height. It needs no input and cannot be
//! stopped by a wall, so every run takes the same path at the same pace.
