# bevy-explorer

- Read `docs/guidelines/README.md` first: the security model, how to contribute,
  scheduling, code style, platforms, the bevy fork, and the things that look like bugs but
  aren't.
- When adding or changing a runtime feature, expose the state and controls a tester needs
  in its owning plugin's [debug panel section](docs/guidelines/recipes.md#a-plugin-section-in-the-runtime-debug-panel).
  Verify the readings and actions through the running HUD.
- `source/react-web/`: the web explorer's HUD (React). Read `source/react-web/AGENTS.md`
  before changing it.
- `source/` is the engine's own Cargo workspace; build and run from there. `README.md` here
  covers how the rest of dcl-one consumes the build.
- Validate a built Explorer through the [E2E driver](../../apps/bevy-explorer/e2e/README.md)
  without requiring user input. For desktop builds, use the authenticated loopback console
  to drive the client, query `/world_state`, and capture a rendered frame with `/screenshot`.
