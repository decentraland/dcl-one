# Create or update the one CI status comment on a pull request, replacing only one section
# (build | tests | performance | automation | inworld). The writers call this through the
# bevy-explorer-ci-status composite action: Bevy Explorer / CI status (build, tests) and Bevy Explorer /
# Benchmark (performance). Each writer's bot comment collapses into one.
#
# The comment is keyed by the hidden <!-- bevy-explorer-ci-status --> marker and holds the $HEADER
# heading plus one fenced block per section:
#
#   <!-- bevy-explorer-ci-status -->
#   ### 🚦 Bevy Explorer CI
#   <!-- ci:build:start -->       …build…       <!-- ci:build:end -->
#   <!-- ci:tests:start -->       …tests…       <!-- ci:tests:end -->
#   <!-- ci:performance:start --> …performance… <!-- ci:performance:end -->
#   <!-- ci:automation:start -->  …automation…  <!-- ci:automation:end -->
#   <!-- ci:inworld:start -->     …inworld…     <!-- ci:inworld:end -->

# read-modify-write would drop a section or create a duplicate comment. Each attempt collapses any
# duplicates (keeping the oldest), rewrites only its own section on that comment, then re-reads to
# confirm the section landed and no duplicate slipped in, retrying otherwise.
#
# Environment: REPO (owner/name), PR_NUMBER, SECTION, and the body in SECTION_BODY or, for a body
# too large to pass comfortably through the environment, in the file SECTION_BODY_FILE.
