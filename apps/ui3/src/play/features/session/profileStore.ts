// The HUD's one source for who a player is, keyed by address. Every surface that shows a name or a
// face for an address reads it from here — chat lines, the profile card, the passport — rather than
// each keeping its own copy with its own lifetime (the nearby roster is replaced wholesale every
// poll, so anything resolved from it alone degrades to a bare address the moment its owner walks
// off). What an entry holds grows as more is learned: the identity the nearby roster or friends
// list already carries, then the engine's own copy of the profile once the store has asked for it.
//
// Liveness is by subscription. `useProfile` subscribes its component to one address for as long as
// it is mounted, so a chat line on screen keeps its sender resolved however long ago they left; an
// entry nobody has shown for a while is swept. The engine announces profile changes (the
// `profileChanged` stream); an entry someone is still showing is re-read, the rest forget their copy.
