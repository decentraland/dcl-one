//! One SIGINT / SIGTERM policy for every command, so Ctrl-C always ends the process.
//!
//! The moment any code polls `tokio::signal::ctrl_c()`, tokio owns SIGINT for the whole
//! process: a signal nobody happens to be awaiting is swallowed, and a second Ctrl-C while
//! a teardown stalls does nothing. `start` listened cooperatively and then killed two
//! process groups, each of which may block for a second; `host` and the signing flows never
//! listened at all. So there is exactly one owner, installed first thing by `main`:
//!
//! - a signal with a cooperative listener armed (`shutdown_signal` is being awaited) is
//!   theirs: they tear down and return, and `main` exits. A grace period starts; if the
//!   teardown is still running when it ends, the process exits anyway. That is for a
//!   sender that signals once and waits -- a script, `timeout`, a test harness, systemd --
//!   since a person just presses Ctrl-C again;
//! - a second signal exits at once;
//! - a signal with no listener armed exits at once, which is what the default action did
//!   before tokio took the signal over, now with the child process groups killed too.
//!
//! Every exit here runs the child-group kills, because `kill_on_drop` fires on a clean drop
//! only and `process::exit` drops nothing.
