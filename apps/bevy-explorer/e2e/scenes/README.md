# Visual scenes

The 17 SDK7 scenes of explorer-automation's Visual suite (`explorer/scenes/packages` at
`955b338`, 2026-10-22), copied once: each exercises one rendering path (primitives and
transforms, glTF models, materials, lights, text, UI, tweens, raycasts, animations, the avatar)
and ends in `setupVisualTest`, which hides avatars and locks a virtual camera, so a frame of it
is deterministic. Their Unity baselines were not copied: every reference is recorded anew by
dcl-one's CI (`../references`).

The scenes were authored for one host scene that swapped bundles. Here every scene is a member of
`dcl-workspace.json` at its own parcels, `12k,0` for its index `k` in that list (the widest scene
spans three parcels, so none can see another), with the host's `skyboxConfig.fixedTime` of 43200
(noon). Positions in a scene's source are scene-relative, so nothing else changed. The visual spec
(`../specs/visual`) teleports to each scene's base parcel.

Build them with `apps/dcl-scene-cli` (the vendored SDK toolchain, no npm):

```sh
DCL_SCENE_CLI=/path/to/dcl-scene-cli npm run build-scenes          # every scene
DCL_SCENE_CLI=/path/to/dcl-scene-cli npm run build-scenes -- core   # one
```

`bin/`, `node_modules/` and the other build outputs are ignored. The `.glb`, `.png` and `.jpg`
assets are in Git LFS.
