//! The walk the marketplace chain indexes share (`nft`, `trade_events`):
//! `eth_getLogs` through the land_authz client over one window at a time,
//! every filter group's address list split in chunks the endpoint accepts,
//! the window's logs and the cursor advance committed together by the
//! caller together with the cursor hash, a request budget per pass (the backpressure: a catch-up is many
//! passes, each leaving a durable `last_block`), Polygon milestone finality
//! and Ethereum confirmation depth, a reorg check of the cursor block's hash at the start of
//! every pass, and the publish marker (`folded_block`) set only when the
//! index reaches the head within the publish lag.
//!
//! `shop.chain_cursor` is one row per (indexer, network). A cursor
//! created at the indexer's start block records `full_history`; one started
//! at `MARKETPLACE_INDEX_START_BLOCK_*` (a bounded development or
//! measurement window) never publishes, and neither does one held short by
//! `MARKETPLACE_INDEX_STOP_BLOCK_*`. Readers trust an index through
//! [`is_ready`]: `folded_block = last_block` and `folded_at` at most
//! [`READY_WINDOW`] old at the caller's clock.
