//! Shop: the unified Shop that absorbs the Marketplace, the credits checkout
//! and treasury (SHOP.md, "One implementation"). One module tree, one
//! canonical router ([`router`], nested at `/shop-api`), the legacy prefixes
//! (`/marketplace-api`, `/credits`, `/transactions-api`, `/signatures-api`,
//! the root aliases) mounted by `main.rs` onto the same handlers with their
//! exact old paths, a signed request always verified over the path it was
//! signed for (never redirected or rewritten):
//!
//! | module | what it holds | tables |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | [`market`] | the marketplace-server surface (catalog, items, nfts, orders, bids, sales, trades, lists, picks, moderation, federation), the mirrors, the chain indexes, the subgraph readers, and the Catalyst lambdas that share its state | `shop.*` (schemas/30_shop.sql) |
//! | [`coupons`] | creator discount coupons (`/v1/coupons`) and the CouponManager state reader, over the market's state | `shop.coupons`, `shop.coupon_state` |
//! | [`credits`] | the credits program: wallets, ledger, packs, Stripe, the cart checkout, authorizations, the CreditUsed index | `credits.*` (the accounting namespace, schemas/60_ops.sql) |
//! | [`checkout`] | the broker, escrow and NAME custody settlement the node executes itself, over `crate::evm`'s signers | `shop.broker_purchases`, `shop.escrow_actions`, `shop.name_transfers`, `shop.usage_grants` |
//! | [`treasury`] | what the relayer account holds and receives (the MANA payment readers and verifier) | none yet |
//! | [`outfits`] | the curated shoppable looks of shop-server (authoring behind the creator allowlist, thumbnails in the blob store) | `shop.outfits`, `shop.outfit_thumbnails` |
//! | [`subscriptions`] | the "notify me when available" waitlist of shop-server (signed subscriptions, the availability watcher, the delivery outbox) | `shop.item_notify_requests`, `shop.item_notify_outbox`, `shop.item_availability_watch` |
//! | [`rentals`] | the LAND/estate rentals listings store (the old signatures service) and the `rentals` chain index that moves a listing's status | `signatures.*`, `shop.rental_event` |
//! | [`mana`] | the MANA purchases: quotes with the rule applied, seller/owner actions, tracked executions | `shop.executions` |
//! | [`types`], [`policy`], [`policy_entry`], [`guards`] | the canonical identities, money units, THE payment rule, the readers that turn an entry's inputs into its facts, and the guard at every entry | none |
//!
//! Every public path that prices or spends credits, with the guard that
//! closes it, is a row of [`paths::CREDIT_PATHS`]; [`paths::ALIASES`] pairs
//! each renamed route with its legacy paths.

// The crates this one builds on, under their module names (AGENTS.md).
