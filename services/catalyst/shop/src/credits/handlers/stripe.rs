//! `POST /stripe/webhook`: the signature is verified over the raw body
//! before any row is touched; then ONE transaction lands the event claim,
//! the purchase flip and the wallet move, granting `purchases.credits`
//! (captured at intent/session creation), never the event's metadata, and
//! only for a settled payment in the purchase's currency and amount. A
//! reversal REVOKES the granted Credits, bounded by the purchase. Stripe
//! does not order deliveries, so a reversal is also recorded against its
//! PaymentIntent, and a grant that lands after it applies it in the same
//! transaction; both serialize on the PaymentIntent.
//!
//! The Stripe endpoint must deliver every event handled below, among them
//! `checkout.session.completed`, `checkout.session.async_payment_succeeded`,
//! `checkout.session.async_payment_failed` and `payment_intent.succeeded`. A
//! delayed payment method completes its session unpaid, which records the
//! session's payment intent on the order. When the payment clears, whichever
//! of `async_payment_succeeded` and `payment_intent.succeeded` lands first
//! credits it, through the same grant, and the other adds nothing. Both are
//! needed: a `payment_intent.succeeded` that arrives before the completion
//! recorded the intent finds no order, and only the session's event credits
//! it then. `payment_intent.payment_failed` is not handled: it also fires for
//! an attempt the buyer retried in the open session, and a late delivery of
//! one would fail an order whose debit is still on its way.
