//! The one revocation entry point: a permission or block edit made outside
//! the gatekeeper (worlds' core maps its `Revocation` onto
//! [`RoomRevocation`]) evicts the affected participants from the running
//! LiveKit rooms through [`CommsState::revoke`], detached from the caller (an
//! SFU outage is logged under `comms-revocation`, never surfaced to the
//! edit). Untested against a real SFU until one is dialled; the dev
//! placeholders skip it.
