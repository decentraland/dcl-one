//! Badges whose input is a count of rows the node keeps whole, recounted
//! against the stored progress instead of read as a log (the mirrors are
//! rewritten on every walk, so no position orders their changes):
//!
//! - emote creator / wearable designer: the creator's Polygon items in
//!   `shop.items` (upstream counted each `item-published` of the L2
//!   collections subgraph once by item id); a creator is recounted while
//!   their item count exceeds their steps;
//! - open for business, collection half: a Polygon collection by the creator
//!   in `shop.collections` (upstream's `collection-created`);
//! - referral: the referrer's accepted invitations in
//!   `social.referral_progress` (`tier_granted`), the steps set to that count
//!   (upstream's `steps++` per event double counted a redelivery).
//!
//! The mirrors are read once their first complete pass is recorded
//! (`shop.mirror_state`). Each recount's `badge_cursors.position` counts its
//! completed passes; the first pass (`0`) brings the stored progress up to
//! the node's rows without notifying, so a node never announces history. A
//! pass walks the candidates in address order and records the last one it
//! recounted (`resume_after`), so a wallet the evaluator cannot move (an
//! imported document whose flag is not `true`) never holds back the ones
//! after it; the next pass starts over.
