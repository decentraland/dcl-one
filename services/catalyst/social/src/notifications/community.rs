//! Community notifications: the rows notifications-workers writes for each
//! community event social-service-ea broadcasts, produced here in process.
//!
//! The recipients follow upstream's broadcaster
//! (`src/logic/community/broadcaster.ts` of `decentraland/social-service-ea`
//! at `b6b2cef`) and the metadata follows the processor's event parser
//! (`processor/src/logic/event-parser.ts` of
//! `decentraland/notifications-workers` at `0f113fb`). A recipient who opted
//! out of the community (`subscription_opt_outs`, scope `community`) gets no
//! row, as the processor's opt-out filter drops it. Each row's id is a v5 uuid
//! over (type, recipient, event key), so a repeated event (a re-ban, whose key
//! is stable upstream) is the same row. A failure is logged and never fails
//! the request that caused it, as upstream's fire-and-forget broadcast.
