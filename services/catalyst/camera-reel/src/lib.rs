//! Camera reel: the player photo gallery behind `camera-reel-service`:
//! uploads (multipart and base64 JSON) with a generated 640x360 thumbnail,
//! per-user galleries and counts under `MAX_IMAGES_PER_USER`, public place
//! and world galleries, the public photos of people wearing an item, owner
//! visibility and deletion, the moderator's review status and delete.
//! Schema `camera_reel` (`schemas/50_create.sql`).
//!
//! What it reuses rather than duplicates: the ONE pool ([`db`]), the ONE
//! blob store (`storage`) for the image and thumbnail bytes by
//! `auth::hash_bytes_v1` hash. The wire URLs retain the upload's UUID and
//! basename under the literal configured `api_url`; reserved filename characters
//! are not URL-escaped. Rows without a retained basename keep hash URLs.
//! Signed fetch uses the shared signature primitives with a one-minute
//! expiration, mandatory raw metadata, the 6.x payload followed by legacy
//! fallback, and the process's EIP-1654 validator. World names resolve through
//! local `explore.place_indexed` reads ([`db::Database::world_place_ids`]).
//!
//! Every write route goes behind `CREATE_WRITES_ENABLED` ([`writes`];
//! default false, 503 with `Retry-After`, built the way `social::writes`
//! gates the social writes); the reads (galleries, metadata, blobs, the
//! batch place gallery behind `POST /api/places/images`) serve either way.
//! CORS is actix-cors's as upstream configured it ([`http`]); the query and
//! JSON body rejections are actix's plain-text 400/413 ([`http`]); a path
//! or method no route serves is an empty 404.
//!
//! Photo events: camera-reel-service published `photo-taken` and
//! `photo-privacy-changed` to SNS; here the domains call each other in
//! process, with no broker. Each event is recorded, with the upstream body,
//! in the outbox `camera_reel.photo_events` ([`events`]) in the transaction
//! of the change it reports. The community photo counts that
//! social-service-ea derived from `photo-taken` are applied directly in the
//! upload's finalising transaction (`social::communities::ranking::record_photo`);
//! no consumer currently reads the outbox. `photo-privacy-changed` has no
//! consumer.
//!
//! Authorization: an upload's `metadata.userAddress`
//! must be the signer (and the row's CHECK holds the pair together);
//! private rows are listed only to their owner (an unverifiable chain reads
//! as anonymous); delete and visibility are the owner's (403 for anyone
//! else, 404 for an absent row); the admin routes take the bearer
//! `CATALYRST_CAMERA_REEL_ADMIN_TOKEN` (403 unset, 401 wrong); a `rejected`
//! row is omitted from public galleries and its metadata answers 404.
//! Its blobs answer 404 on the protected byte routes of the ONE store:
//! the reel's `GET /api/files/{name}` (from `review_status`), the content server's
//! `/contents/{hash}` at the root and under the worlds nest and the
//! builder's `/contents/{hash}` (from `camera_reel.withheld_blobs`, written
//! in the review's and the delete's transaction and mirrored into the shared
//! in-memory `content::Denylist`, refilled at boot by
//! [`State::load_withheld`]). A hash is
//! newly withheld only when no non-rejected row and no content file or builder
//! upload names it, so an owner's delete cannot hide a deployed file of the
//! same bytes. A later successful upload can release deletion withholding;
//! it does not release rejected hashes or operator and remote denials. A private, non-rejected photo is served to whoever holds its
//! filename URL or hash. Deletion removes the gallery row and applies withholding
//! without unlinking immutable shared blobs. `GET /api/files/{name}` serves only
//! a hash a non-rejected camera row names; arbitrary content files cannot be
//! downloaded through this route. Beside the offset pages: a keyset page
//! (`?cursor=`) over the same order, `nextCursor` on the wire only when
//! asked for.
//!
//! `GET /api/images/{name}` redirects whether or not the object exists.
//! With no bucket origin configured, the target is `/api/files/{name}`,
//! which resolves exact filename aliases and checks the underlying hash's
//! denylist. With a configured bucket origin (an http(s) URL without
//! credentials, query or fragment; anything else falls back to
//! `/api/files`), redirects retain the requested filename without reading the
//! database, and a hash the shared denylist withholds answers 404 instead.
//! Point that origin at `/api/files` or configure its ingress to resolve
//! filenames; a hash-only origin is insufficient. An external origin must
//! enforce its own object availability; this process only controls local
//! bytes. Filename aliases retain the photo's accepted upload MIME
//! for both objects; older rows without it and raw hash URLs sniff stored bytes.
//! The local byte route serves complete GET responses; it
//! does not implement byte ranges or ETag validators, and its HEAD response is 404.
//!
//! Mount: `.nest("/camera-reel-service", camera_reel::router(state))`;
//! the router's own paths are `/api/...`, `/admin/...`, `/health`. It is not
//! merged at the root: `/api/places/{id}/...` is the explore places
//! surface there. A per-vhost proxy for `camera-reel-service.<domain>`
//! forwards `/x` to `/camera-reel-service/x`; a client signs the path it
//! requested, which is what the camera verifier checks
//! (`signed_fetch::candidate_paths`, the ONE path rule: the request's own
//! path, and the `x-original-path` the proxy sets when it ends with the
//! route).
//!
//! `/metrics` exposes this router's request counts and latency histograms.
//! Scrapes require `CAMERA_REEL_METRICS_BEARER_TOKEN`; an unset token fails closed.
//! Documentation and Swagger UI assets are served locally under `/api/docs`.
