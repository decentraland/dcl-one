//! Partial (multi-request) scene uploads, ADR-325: `POST /entities` with the
//! form field `partial=true` (and, recommended, `?partial=true`, which
//! declares the batch before its body is read). Upstream
//! `src/logic/partial-deployments/component.ts`, its repository
//! (`adapters/pending-deployments-repository`) and `docs/PARTIAL_UPLOADS.md`
//! at `decentraland/catalyst` a416565.
//!
//! Each batch carries `entityId`, the auth chain and files keyed by their
//! content hash. The first one must carry the entity file (IPFS v2 scenes
//! only, at most 10 MiB); later ones by the account that started the upload
//! may leave it out and it is read back from the store. A batch is checked
//! without holding anything (hashes, the staging subset of the validator, the
//! newer-entity, rate-limit and TTL checks), then, under the entity's lock,
//! accounted against the quotas, stored, and recorded in
//! `content.pending_deployments` / `content.pending_deployment_files`. While
//! content is missing the answer is `202 {"missing": [...]}`; the batch that
//! completes the upload publishes it through the write deployer, which
//! validates it in full (content already in the store), and answers
//! `200 {"creationTimestamp"}`. A batch for an entity already deployed answers
//! 200 with the stored `local_timestamp`.
//!
//! Quotas, with upstream's messages and `Retry-After` on each 429: uploads
//! per account, live uploads per parcel (and per account on a parcel), staged
//! bytes per account and per server, batch bytes per account per minute, the
//! scene size cap. An upload lives `PENDING_DEPLOYMENT_TTL` from its first
//! batch; the leased `content-partial-uploads-cleanup` job deletes expired
//! uploads and unlinks the staged blobs they wrote themselves (a receipt's
//! `written`) that the collector would: past its age floor, outside its
//! fixed references (asset packs, global scenes) and named by no domain
//! ([`gc::unlink_orphans`], which knows the pending tables). A blob still
//! younger than the floor is left to the collector: a regular deploy may be
//! committing it (the SDK skips what `/available-content` reports).
//!
//! The entity's lock is PostgreSQL's, so it holds across replicas: a
//! session advisory lock on a connection of its own, held from a batch's
//! accounting through its publication (or its release of an overtaken
//! upload). Cleanup takes it without waiting and skips an upload whose lock
//! is held, so it never drops an upload a batch is committing.
//!
//! The quota 429s' Retry-After counts from the last cleanup run, which
//! every replica reads from `content.system_properties`
//! (`partial_uploads_cleanup_at`).
//!
//! The budgets are made atomic by one server-wide advisory lock
//! (`partial-upload-budget`, as upstream's `acquireBudgetLock`): every
//! batch's accounting on every replica runs under it, and sums
//! `reserved_bytes` over all of `content.pending_deployments`. Its cost
//! grows with the live uploads (bounded by the per-account caps) and
//! serializes accounting, not storage or publication; it has not been
//! measured, so raise the upload caps only after measuring it.
//!
//! As upstream, staged blobs go to the one content store, so
//! `/contents/{hash}` serves them before publication (upstream stores a
//! batch with `storeStreamsInBatches` into the served `storage`): an
//! account may hold `MAX_PENDING_BYTES_PER_DEPLOYER` of content for up to
//! `PENDING_DEPLOYMENT_TTL`.
//!
//! Not as upstream: a batch is held in memory like a regular deploy, so it
//! keeps the in-memory upload budget; a declared batch from a source that
//! spent its daily quota, or from an account over its byte rate, is turned
//! away before its files are buffered ([`admit_before_files`]), on the
//! claimed signer and entity (authentication follows). There is no shared
//! content lock against the collector: the receipts are written before the
//! blobs, and the collector reads them.
