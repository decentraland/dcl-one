//! Upstream forwarding: a deployment this node accepted from a client
//! (`POST /entities`, content or worlds) is sent on, unchanged, to the
//! catalyst or worlds content server the operator names
//! (`CONTENT_FORWARD_UPSTREAM_URL`, `WORLDS_FORWARD_UPSTREAM_URL`). Local
//! authority is untouched: the deploy commits here as before, and the same
//! statement (content) or transaction (worlds) queues one outbox row
//! (`content.forward_outbox`, `worlds.forward_outbox`). The leased worker
//! below sends it after the commit, so a crash between the two leaves a
//! queued row the next worker sends; the deploy's answer is the local one.
//!
//! A send is what catalyst-client's `deploy` does: ask the upstream which
//! files it already holds (`GET /available-content?cid=..`, split under the
//! client's 2,048-byte URL bound; a question the upstream refuses sends the
//! files), then POST one multipart form: `entityId`,
//! `authChain[i][type|payload|signature]`, the entity file and every content
//! file the upstream lacks, each file a part named by its hash. The entity
//! part is the stored bytes (the id is their hash) and the chain the stored
//! links, so the upstream verifies the signature the client made.
//!
//! Per row: 2xx `accepted`; 404, 405 (the route is missing: a read-only
//! catalyst), 408, 425, 429, 5xx, a status past 599 or a transport error
//! retry with a doubling delay until `FORWARD_MAX_ATTEMPTS` (then `failed`);
//! any other status is the upstream's verdict, `rejected`, its body kept. A
//! row whose deployment is no longer this node's before it was sent (content:
//! overwritten or unpublished; worlds: replaced, undeployed or mirrored over)
//! is `superseded` and never sent: a worlds upstream applies the last publish
//! it receives, so an old scene sent late would roll the world back, and a
//! scene its LAND holder took down stays down. Unpublishes are not forwarded.
//!
//! Both upstreams refuse an entity signed too long ago ([`Lane::max_age_ms`]:
//! catalyst 20 minutes, a worlds server 5), so a forward has that long from
//! the signature: an entity past it is `failed` unsent (after a long outage,
//! or a claim a dead worker held for [`SEND_LEASE`]) and only its signer's
//! new deploy reaches the upstream. A shutdown gives its send in flight back
//! as due, unsent; rows queued for another target are closed once past every
//! window ([`Forwarder::close_foreign`]). The operator requeues a `rejected`,
//! `failed` or stranded record for the current target while its entity is
//! inside the window ([`Forwarder::requeue`], the lanes' `.../retry` routes).
