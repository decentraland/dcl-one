//! A viewer's favorite and like of a place or a world: `PATCH
//! /api/{places,worlds}/{id}/{favorites,likes}` (upstream places
//! `UserFavorite/routes.ts`, `UserLikes/routes.ts`,
//! `World/routes/updateWorld{Favorites,Likes}.ts`) and `PUT`/`DELETE`
//! `/v1/destinations/{id}/{favorites,likes}`, signed fetch, behind
//! `DATA_WRITES_ENABLED`.
//!
//! The facts are `explore.user_favorites` and `explore.user_likes` (one row
//! per viewer and entity, local authority), each carrying the voter's
//! Snapshot voting power as `user_activity` ([`super::voting_power`],
//! upstream `fetchScore`). The counters the routes answer are upstream's
//! numbers (`explore.place.{favorites,likes,dislikes}`, the mirror's) plus
//! this node's own, kept in `explore.place_interaction_counts`: recounted
//! from the two fact tables in the fact's transaction under a lock on the
//! entity's counter row (so two writes on one entity serialise), as
//! upstream's `buildUpdate{Favorites,Likes}Query`
//! (`shared/entityInteractions.ts:111-160`) recount theirs, and rebuildable
//! from the facts ([`rebuild_counts`]).
//!
//! `like_rate` and `like_score` weigh only voters with `user_activity >=
//! 100` (`MIN_USER_ACTIVITY`), `like_score` by upstream's Wilson lower
//! bound. The mirror holds upstream's rates, not its voters, so the combined
//! rate is computed over upstream's qualified votes reconstructed from the
//! mirrored `likes`, `dislikes`, `like_rate` and `like_score`
//! ([`upstream_qualified_votes`]) plus this node's qualified votes; it is
//! stored on the counter row only once a local qualified vote exists (NULL
//! keeps the reads on the mirrored value). In that reconstruction a wallet
//! that voted upstream and here counts twice.
//!
//! The ground truth replaces the reconstruction: upstream's own `user_likes`
//! rows, imported from its database export ([`import_upstream_likes`],
//! `catalyst explore import-likes`) as facts with `source = 'upstream'`,
//! keyed like this node's by wallet and entity, so a wallet's later local
//! vote overrides its imported one (the vote's value, not its `source`,
//! which records where the row came from and never changes) and nobody
//! counts twice. The import settles each entity it covers: it records on
//! the counter row (`imported`, the rows the export held for the entity)
//! that the facts are the whole truth, and from then on the reads take the
//! entity's totals and rates from the fact table alone, even after every
//! imported voter withdraws; the mirrored aggregates no longer enter, and a
//! later import leaves a settled entity alone. The record is the import's,
//! outside the recounts and the rebuild.
//!
//! Lock order: a fact of entity E is written only under E's counter row
//! (`lock_counts`), and whoever takes several counter rows takes them in
//! entity id order, so the import and the votes wait on each other and
//! never deadlock.
