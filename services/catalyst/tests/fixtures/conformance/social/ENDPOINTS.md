# Social family: endpoint enumeration

The exhaustive `social-service-ea` registration and per-operation review backlog
is [PARITY.md](PARITY.md), backed by [parity.json](parity.json). It counts 72 API
HTTP registrations, five API auxiliary operations, five uWS HTTP operations,
two WebSocket upgrades, 33 RPC methods and six JSON subscriptions at
`b6b2cefefdf727b2ed47ddb887e77d226a41eea6`: 123 separately tracked operations.
HTTP and RPC twins, streams, conditional bearer routes, framework health/CORS,
metrics and fallbacks each have their own row. Production captures listed below
cover only their recorded requests and do not certify the other operations.

Baseline = the production `*.decentraland.org` services; candidate = a Catalyst node
(`serve`), which mounts each service under the configured gateway prefix (`/social-api`, `/comms-gatekeeper`,
`/notifications`, `/badges`, `/profile-images`, `/camera-reel-service`).
The rpc-social-service-ea host is mounted at `/social-rpc`.
Captured by `tests/conformance/capture/social.mjs`; the request log is
`MANIFEST.md` (rendered from `manifest.json`), the fixtures sit in one
directory per service with the raw response (`<name>.raw.json` +
`<name>.raw.body`) beside each replay-format `<name>.json`.

Sources: social-api and rpc-social-service-ea are read from a fresh clone of
`github.com/decentraland/social-service-ea` at the pinned revision below (committed
2026-10-30). The captured fixtures were recorded against production running
`fb3dcb80f8cac53485696a5f7c94b720b20ae6c9` (the rpc-host `/status` `commitHash` on
2026-10-26); the routes that revision lacks (the friends, blocks, settings and voice
HTTP routes and `/v1/stream`, upstream #503-#507) have no capture. The other services were read at the revision each checkout had on
2026-09-25 (not pinned by local checkout; the SHA is what
`git -c safe.directory='*' -C <repo> show HEAD:<path>` resolved to):

Capturable = an unauthenticated GET/HEAD/OPTIONS, or a POST whose body only
reads, or a signed read the run's throwaway key can issue. "signed" means
ADR-44 signed fetch; the fixture then records the throwaway wallet's auth
chain (timestamp-bound, so a replay must re-sign) and the baseline answer is
the authenticated shape for a wallet nothing is stored under. Everything
that writes (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE with effect), needs a service bearer
token or an operator role, is listed as not capturable.

Local routes with no production counterpart on this host, not captured:

### The social RPC's HTTP twins (#504-#507)

These routes answer from the same operations as their RPC procedures
(`social/src/rpc/service/mod.rs` `ops`), so they write the same rows and publish
the same updates; `social/src/rpc/tests/social_api.rs` covers each route, the
signed-fetch gate, the body and path checks and a route/procedure parity case.
Refusals render `{ error, message }`: 400 `Bad request` for the path checks
and the handlers' own body checks with upstream's messages (`Invalid address`,
`You cannot block yourself`,
`direction must be one of: received, sent`, `At most 50 addresses can be
requested`, `Invalid callId`, ...), 403 `Forbidden`, 404 `Not Found`, 409
`Conflict` and 429 `Too Many Requests` as upstream's `friends-errors.ts` and
`voice-chats-errors.ts` map them (local `social/src/rpc/http.rs:130`,
`social/src/communities/http.rs:203`). A body that fails the schema answers 400
as `@dcl/schema-validator-component` 1.0.1 does: `{ ok: false, message:
"Invalid JSON body", data: [<the first AJV error, in AJV's evaluation order>] }`,
and a body that is not JSON `{ ok: false, message }`; a community id is checked
against upstream's `UUID_PATTERN` (local `social/src/rpc/http.rs:194-240`,
`:317`; `a_body_failing_the_schema_answers_as_the_schema_validator`). The served
`/social-api/openapi.json` carries the twins' paths, the schemas they reference
and the `SignedFetch` scheme from upstream `docs/openapi.yaml`
(`library/catalyst-api/openapi/communities.openapi.json`;
`the_served_openapi_documents_every_route`). Open differences:

- A body that is not JSON carries V8's message only when it is empty
  (`Unexpected end of JSON input`); any other parse error carries serde's
  wording (local `social/src/rpc/http.rs:241-247`).
- A friendship request's `createdAt` is the action's time, as the procedure's
  `accepted.created_at` (upstream: the friendship row's `created_at`, upstream
  `src/logic/friends/component.ts:552`).
- `PATCH /v1/social-settings` writes the row only: local Comms Gatekeeper reads
  the same table, so there is no remote privacy sync to order.
- A non-`DELETE` method on `/v1/community-voice-chats/active` answers 405 from
  the listing route, where upstream would treat `active` as a community id.
- `/v1/stream` (`RPC.md` has its rows): the per-address channel falling
  behind (256 events of any stream) also closes `Subscription overflow`, and the
  `Slow consumer` trigger counts the writer task's queue, not uWS's buffered
  amount, so a very small `WS_MAX_BACKPRESSURE` can trip on scheduling delay
  (local `social/src/rpc/stream.rs:311-356`, `:846-850`).
- `WS_IDLE_TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS` is not read, and one `AUTH_WINDOW_SECS` stands
  for `WS_AUTH_TIMEOUT_IN_MS` and `WS_AUTH_SIGNATURE_EXPIRATION_IN_MS`.

### Community writes and notifications (read at `social-service-ea` @ `b6b2cef`)

The write routes are not capturable; their behaviour was read from the
upstream source (paths below are in `decentraland/social-service-ea` at
`b6b2cef`, notification rows in `decentraland/notifications-workers` at
`0f113fb`) and is pinned by the tests named per row (in
`social/src/communities/tests/upstream_writes.rs` unless stated).

| behaviour | upstream | local | tests |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `PUT /v1/communities/{id}` `placeIds`: a JSON array of strings replaces the places, `[]` clears, an empty field changes nothing, anything else 400 "placeIds must be a valid JSON array"; only ids the community does not hold are ownership-checked (401 "The user {address} doesn't own all the places"); the answer carries `message: "Community updated successfully"` | `src/logic/community/communities.ts` `updateCommunity`, `fields-validator.ts`, `places.ts` `updatePlaces` | `social/src/communities/communities.rs:754`, `:822`, `write_support.rs:94` | `place_ids_replace_the_places_checking_only_the_new_ones`, `write_support.rs` `multipart_hands_the_validator_the_raw_case` |
| private to public accepts every pending request to join of a wallet the community does not ban, in the update's transaction | `communities.ts` `updateCommunity`, `src/adapters/communities-db.ts` `acceptAllRequestsToJoin` | `communities.rs:845` | `going_public_accepts_the_pending_requests_to_join_of_unbanned_wallets` |
| `PATCH /v1/communities/{id}/members/{address}` `role: "owner"` transfers ownership: owner only (401 "...doesn't have permission to transfer ownership in community {id}"), target a member (401 "The target user {address} is not a member of community {id}") holding a NAME (400 "The user {address} doesn't have any names"); the old owner becomes moderator | `src/logic/community/members.ts` `transferOwnership`, `roles.ts` `validatePermissionToTransferOwnership`, `communities-db.ts` `transferCommunityOwnership` | `social/src/communities/members.rs:709`, `:748` | `the_owner_role_transfers_ownership_to_a_named_member`, `tests.rs` `every_route_answers_its_contract` |
| `onlyMemberOf=true` lists by role (owner, moderator, the rest), then name; every other listing by rank | `src/logic/queries.ts` `withSearchAndPagination` (`sortBy: 'role'`) | `social/src/communities/queries.rs:351` | `only_member_of_lists_by_role_then_name` |
| `COMMUNITIES_PLACES_OWNERSHIP_CHECK` defaults to true: upstream always asks the places API (`PLACES_API_URL` is required); here the in-process catalogue and LAND authority answer | `src/logic/community/places.ts` `validateOwnership`, `src/adapters/places-api.ts` | `config/src/social.rs:31`, `social/src/communities/mod.rs:456` | `place_ids_replace_the_places_checking_only_the_new_ones` |
| `GET /v1/community-voice-chats/active`: a non-member's room carries the positions and worlds of the community's places and is listed only when it has one; a member's carries none; a community that bans the caller is not listed | `src/logic/community-voice/community-voice.ts` `getActiveCommunityVoiceChatsForUser`, `src/utils/places.ts` | `social/src/communities/voice.rs:55`, `queries.rs:1225`, `places.rs:126` | `a_non_member_sees_a_room_only_through_its_places_and_never_when_banned`, `tests.rs` `voice_status_derives_from_the_presence_rows` |
| bans rows: `bannedAt` with milliseconds and `Z`; v1 and v2 carry the caller's `friendshipStatus` | `communities-db.ts` `getBannedMembers`, `src/logic/community/utils.ts` `mapMembersWithProfiles` | `social/src/communities/dto.rs:266`, `members.rs:318` | `ban_rows_carry_millisecond_banned_at_and_the_friendship_status` |
| `isHostingLiveEvent` on the signed `GET /v1/communities/{id}` and `/v2/communities/{id}` (absent from the public read), `false` on create; read from explore's events (`community_id`, live list) in process | `src/logic/community/events.ts` `isCurrentlyHostingEvents`, `communities.ts` `getCommunity` | `social/src/communities/communities.rs:369`, `:458`, `:467` | `a_signed_detail_says_whether_the_community_hosts_a_live_event` |
| notification rows (`social.notifications`, an opted-out recipient skipped, one row per type, recipient and event key): `community_request_to_join_received` (owner and moderators), `_request_to_join_accepted`, `_invite_received`, `_post_added` (members but the author), `_member_removed` (kick), `_member_banned` (a member only, keyed per wallet), `_renamed` (every member), `_deleted` (members but the owner), `_deleted_content_violation` (the owner, when a global moderator deletes), `_ownership_transferred` (the new owner), `_voice_chat_started` (online members but the opener) | `src/logic/community/broadcaster.ts`, `requests.ts`, `posts.ts`, `members.ts`, `bans.ts`, `communities.ts`, `src/logic/community-voice/community-voice.ts`; `processor/src/logic/event-parser.ts` | `social/src/notifications/community.rs:108`, `communities/mod.rs:407`, `requests.rs:634`, `posts.rs:260`, `members.rs:660`, `:911`, `communities.rs:894`, `:1043`, `rpc/service/community_voice.rs:168` | `community_events_write_the_notification_rows_upstream_publishes`, `a_global_moderators_deletion_tells_the_owner_of_the_violation`, `the_owner_role_transfers_ownership_to_a_named_member`, `rpc/tests.rs` `community_voice_start_join_and_ban_semantics`, `a_started_room_carries_the_places_and_the_thumbnail` |
| `POST /v1/referral-email`: signed; 400 "You must have at least 100 accepted invites to set an email", "Email is required", "Email is too long", "Email contains invalid characters", "Invalid email format", then once per 24 hours ("Email can only be updated once per day. Last update was less than 24 hours ago for user: {address}"); 204, the lower-cased email kept in `social.referral_emails` | `src/logic/referral/referral.ts` `setReferralEmail`, `src/controllers/handlers/http/add-referral-email-handler.ts` | `social/src/communities/referral.rs:249`, `:270`, `schemas/40_social.sql:746` | `referral_email_is_checked_and_kept_once_a_day`, `referral.rs` `referral_emails_are_checked_in_upstreams_order` |

Remaining differences, with their reason:

- Referral checks that need a service or deployment value this node does
  not have: the deny list (`assertReferrerNotBanned` and `setReferralEmail`
  fetch `config.decentraland.org/denylist.json`), the same-IP rejection
  (`REFERRAL_MAX_IP_MATCHES` and `invited_user_ip`, deployment configuration
  with no value in the source), the `REFERRAL_REGISTRATION_DISABLED` 503 flag,
  `finalizeReferral` (login-day count in Redis, tier rewards through the
  rewards API, Slack alerts, and with it the `referral_invited_users_accepted`
  and `referral_new_tier_reached` notifications) and the marketing email
  `setReferralEmail` sends; the submitted email stays in
  `social.referral_emails` for the operator.
- The ownership transfer's NAME check reads the target's profile
  `hasClaimedName` (as create does); upstream asks the catalyst for owned names.
- Bans rows keep the local `bannedBy` and `reason` keys and every row with
  placeholder profile fields; upstream's v1 rows also carry
  `lastFriendshipAction` and `actingUser` and drop a wallet without a profile.
- The update answer's `data` is the community detail (role, members count,
  voice status) where upstream returns the stored row (`id`, `name`,
  `description`, `ownerAddress`, `privacy`, `visibility`, `active`).
- A failed ownership lookup (catalogue or LAND authority) answers 502 "failed
  to validate place ownership"; upstream's failed places API call is a 500.
- Notification rows are written before the response, not through a queue;
  `MEMBER_LEFT` writes none, as the processor has no row for it.
- Nothing here sets a referral to `tier_granted` (that is `finalizeReferral`,
  above), so `GET /v1/referral-progress` counts no accepted invite and
  `POST /v1/referral-email` always answers the 100-invites refusal.
- `POST /v1/referral-email` checks the body after the invites count, with
  `setReferralEmail`'s messages; upstream's `AddReferralEmailSchema`
  (`schemas.ts:179`: `email` required, an email-format string, no other key)
  refuses a malformed body first, with the schema validator's message.

## rpc-social-service-ea.decentraland.org (Catalyst: `/social-rpc`)

The uWS server (`src/controllers/routes/uws.routes.ts`). Every HTTP answer
of a wrapped handler, `/health/live` and the catch-all carries
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`.

| method | path | params | capturable | fixtures |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET (WS upgrade) | `/` | dcl-rpc over WebSocket; the first frame is the signed auth chain (`ws-handler.ts`) | the eight reads only, by hand (`social/src/rpc/tests/upstream_reads.rs`) | `_socket/reads.json` (10 calls of a wallet created for the run; behaviour beyond it: `RPC.md`) |
| GET | `/status` | | yes | `status` (`{"version","currentTime","commitHash"}`, all three volatile) |
| ANY | `/health/live` | | yes | `health-live` (200 `alive`, no content-type) |

## comms-gatekeeper.decentraland.org (Catalyst: `/comms-gatekeeper`)

Metadata rules (`src/logic/utils.ts`): the comms handshake (`oldValidate`)
needs a top-level `realmName`; the scene routes need `signer`
`decentraland-kernel-scene` (or `dcl:authoritative-server` for
`/scene-admin`), `realm.{hostname,serverName}`, `sceneId`, `parcel`;
`/private-messages/token` needs `signer` `dcl:explorer`; the community voice
routes and `/users/{address}/voice-chat-status` take the social service's
bearer token; `/bans`, `/users/{address}/warnings` and the ban writes need
the moderator role.

`the_notifications_host_answers_as_its_captures` replays `status`, the
three `-unauth` reads and `unknown-path-404`, and re-signs the five signed
reads with a fresh wallet. `subscription-signed` differs only in
`details.message_type.friend_first_wear` and `.land_transfer_received`
(Catalyst's own types, absent from upstream's `@dcl/schemas` list) and
`.item_discounted` (added upstream after the capture). Not
replayed in process: `preflight-notifications` (200 with `*` for methods and
headers, no `max-age` or `vary`, against 204), `-expired-timestamp` and
`-bad-signature` (the recorded chains) and `unsubscribe-address-no-signature`.

## profile-images.decentraland.org (Catalyst: `/profile-images`)

Production answers every `/entities/{cid}/{face,body}.png` with a `301` to
`https://profile-images-bucket-43d0c58.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/v1/entities/{cid}/{file}`
without checking the CID or the file name (the bucket then answers 200 or a
404 XML document); the explorer follows it. Both hops are captured.

| method | path | params | capturable | fixtures |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/entities/{cid}/face.png` | | yes | `face-profile-{0,1,2}` (301) + `-object` (200 image/png), `face-unknown-cid` + `-object` (404 XML), `face-bad-cid` (301) |
| GET | `/entities/{cid}/body.png` | | yes | `body-profile-{0,1,2}` + `-object`, `body-unknown-cid` |
| HEAD | `/entities/{cid}/face.png` | | yes | `face-head` |
| GET | `/entities/{cid}/other.png` | | yes | `unknown-file` (301 as well) |

| GET | `/` | | yes | `root-404` |
| GET | processor `/status`; POST `/schedule-processing` (bearer) | not on this host | no | |

The three profiles: the corpus CID
`bafkreickiq5m2aj4i4hi4emzcyaqvh2w2wdig325ienuqnkycz5xr5l66a` and the active
profile entities of two public community members (owner and moderator of
the largest public community), resolved through `POST
peer.decentraland.org/content/entities/active`.

## Counts

161 fixtures: social 53, social-rpc 5, gatekeeper 35, notifications 14,
badges 13, profile-images 20, camera-reel 21. 166 production requests plus 4
helper lookups on `peer.decentraland.org` across the six runs listed in
`MANIFEST.md`; the largest per-host total is social-api's 54.

Not captured and why: every write; token-minting reads under a real
identity (`/private-messages/token` signed, `/cast/generate-stream-link`);
bearer-token and moderator routes beyond their error shape (`POST
/v1/members/{address}/communities` included); the rpc host's WebSocket session beyond the reads in
`social-rpc/_socket/reads.json`; `GET /users/{userAddress}/community-voice-chat-status`
(same 401 shape as the captured voice-chat-status).

## Replay of social-api and social-rpc (2026-10-29 04:17 UTC)

`tests/conformance.rs` against revision `fa8f9acc` with the communities
mirror on production and `COMMUNITIES_ADMIN_TOKEN` set (setup and every row:
`tests/conformance/REPORT.md`, "Node setup" and "social"): social-api 32 of
53 identical and 21 different, none genuine (`communities-list-only-voice-chat`
and `community-v2-by-id` differ only in keys that are social-api extensions; the rest is the live listing, profiles not
synced, the mirror's empty member, post and place lists, and two messages that
name the replay's own signer); social-rpc 5 of 5 identical. The member, post
and place lists of the captured community, which the mirror does not copy, are
compared in process against seeded rows
(`social/src/communities/tests/fixture_shapes.rs`, where only the recorded
extension keys still differ).

`communities-list-limit-zero` cannot show a page count: `data.pages` and
`data.total` are volatile for the listing fixtures. The 2026-09-25 replay
against a Catalyst node recorded `pages` 0 vs 2 for it (limit 0 then paged by
zero). `limit=0` now falls back to the default 100, as the capture answers
(`limit` 100, `pages` 2): `social/src/communities/http.rs`, tests
`offset_is_capped_and_ordinary_values_pass_through` (the limit) and
`paginated_page_is_one_based` (the page count).

## Replay of the other services (2026-09-25 19:31-19:40 UTC)

`catalyrst-conformance-replay` (old harness) against the `v2-target` debug
binary built 2026-09-25 18:21 UTC, `serve` on database `catalyst_conf_social`
and port 5461 with the environment (bounded outfits/emote sync from
`peer.decentraland.org`, every mirror's first pass complete within 60 s,
`LIVEKIT_ALLOW_DEV_CREDS=true`), each service replayed with the candidate
`http://127.0.0.1:5461<prefix>`:

| service | passed | expected failures | divergences to look at |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| gatekeeper | 10/35 | 6 signed fixtures "Expired signature"; `scene-participants` 404 (no Pulse/archipelago room state) | unauthenticated scene routes answer `{"error":"Invalid Auth Chain"}` where production answers 400 `{"ok":false,"message":"Invalid Auth Chain"}`; `get-scene-adapter-unauth` 400 vs 401; bearer routes (`voice-chat-status`, `community-voice-chat/*`, `world ban-status`, `private-messages/token`) 503 vs 401/400 (Catalyst has no social-service token configured); `/cast/*` and `/scene-stream-access` 404 (G18 gap, unimplemented at the recorded revision); `ping` body 22 B vs `pong`; `user-bans-bad-address` 400 vs 200; preflight allow-origin reflected vs `*` |
| notifications | 1/14 | 4 signed fixtures 401 | `/status` 404 (route unimplemented at the recorded revision); `/unsubscribe/{address}` 404 (unimplemented at the recorded revision; now served, replayed in-process by `notifications::tests::the_unsigned_unsubscribe_capture_replays`); `?limit=5&onlyUnread&from=0` 400 (valueless `onlyUnread` rejected); opt-outs unknown scope 404 vs 400; every auth error body differs ("Unauthenticated: Expired signature" / "Invalid Auth Chain" vs the ADR-44 message pair); preflight 200 with `*` vs 204 with the requested headers |
| badges | 5/13 | user badges achieved 0 vs 3/5 (empty tables); `badge-tiers` 404 vs 200 empty | `/categories` lists 3 categories, production 5 (Explorer, Collector, Creator, Socializer, Builder); asset URLs: production `https://assets-cdn.decentraland.org/<id>/2d/normal.png`, Catalyst serves `/badges/assets/{path}` under `DEFAULT_ASSET_BASE_URL` `https://badges.decentraland.org`; preflight 200 `*` vs 204 |
| profile-images | 1/20 | the 19 image fixtures: production is a 301 to the bucket, Catalyst renders in process and answered 404 with no profile entities synced (`SYNC_ENTITY_TYPES=outfits,emote`) | structural: an edge redirect versus a direct `image/png`; `face-bad-cid` 400 vs 301; preflight 204 with every method vs the edge's 301 |
| camera-reel | 12/21 | `image-*` 404 (photo not in the local table) | `/api/wearables/{item}/images` 404 (camera-reel-service #62 unimplemented at the recorded revision); preflight `OPTIONS /api/users/{address}` 405 (no CORS layer under `/camera-reel-service`); `docs-openapi` 33 schema differences; `unknown-path-404` body "Not Found" vs empty; `user-images-bad-limit` message text |

Logs: `replay-<service>.log` in the run's scratchpad; the node and its
database were stopped and dropped after the run.
