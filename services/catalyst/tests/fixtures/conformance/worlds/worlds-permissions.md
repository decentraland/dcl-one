# Worlds content server: world permissions

Area: the ten `/world/:world_name/permissions*` routes of the worlds content server, the
legacy-payload signed fetch on `POST .../permissions/:permission_name`, and the side effects a client can
see: participant kicks after an access change, permission notifications, the world-settings event, and
what `GET .../permissions` reveals.

Pinned revisions:

- Upstream: `decentraland/worlds-content-server` @ `10af5255bb04a1a28e0c26bd190317c26a6015a9` (2026-10-21).
- dcl-one: this tree, Rust workspace `services/catalyst`.

Everything below comes from reading the code. Nothing was built or run, and no line is "verified".
Some upstream behaviour comes from packages that are not in the clone. Their published tarballs were
read, not run:

- `@dcl/http-commons@2.0.0`: `errorHandler`, `getPaginationParams`, the error classes;
- `@dcl/schema-validator-component@1.0.1`: the 415/400 bodies;
- `@dcl/crypto-middleware@6.3.0`: `wellKnownComponents`, `verify`, `rejectIfSigner`,
  `assertLegacyMetadataKeys`.

A row that depends on one of them names the package.

Common notes:

- **Mount points.** Upstream serves the routes at its root. dcl-one serves the ten routes at the root
  (`core::root_router`) and again under `/worlds-content-server` (`core::router`), both from
  `timed_routes()` (`services/catalyst/worlds/src/core/mod.rs:640-668`, nested in
  `services/catalyst/worlds/src/lib.rs:428-432`). The signed path is the bare route path on both mounts
  (`SignedPath::from_uris`; test `owner_gated_permission_routes_verify_the_bare_path_through_the_gateway_nest`,
  `worlds/src/core/tests.rs:4620`).
- **Error envelope.** Upstream `@dcl/http-commons` `errorHandler` answers `InvalidRequestError` as
  `400 {"error":"Bad request","message":…}`, `NotFoundError` as `404 {"error":"Not Found",…}`,
  `NotAuthorizedError` as `401 {"error":"Not Authorized",…}`, and anything else as
  `500 {"error":"Internal Server Error"}`. dcl-one's `envelope` uses the same labels
  (`services/catalyst/comms/src/worlds_envelope.rs:124-139`), and adds a 503 with `Retry-After: 1`
  (`worlds_envelope.rs:197-203`). The signed-fetch and schema-validator refusals do not go through
  `errorHandler` upstream, so they have their own shapes (WP-01, WP-02).
- **Signed fetch.** Upstream builds every signed route from `createSignedFetchMiddleware`
  (`decentraland/worlds-content-server:src/controllers/routes.ts:74-96`):
  - `optional:false`;
  - the scene gate `rejectIfSigner('decentraland-kernel-scene')`;
  - `onError → {error: err.message, message: 'This endpoint requires a signed fetch request. See ADR-44.'}`.

  `POST /world/:world_name/permissions/:permission_name` is the only route on the instance that accepts the
  folded pre-6.0.0 payload. Its canonical keys are `signer,type,secret,wallets,communities,nft`
  (`routes.ts:158-165`). The other six signed routes here use the strict instance (`routes.ts:98`).

  dcl-one's `require_verified` (`services/catalyst/comms/src/signed_fetch.rs:131-185`) runs the same
  stages in the same order:
  1. the chain;
  2. the timestamp, with a 60 s window;
  3. the metadata parse;
  4. the scene gate, which refuses a non-canonical or re-cased `signer` (`library/dcl-auth/src/signed_fetch.rs:185-208`);
  5. the 6.x signature;
  6. on a 401, and only when keys are declared: the declared-key guard, then the folded signature.

  `post_permissions` passes `PERMISSIONS_METADATA_KEYS`, which holds the same six keys
  (`services/catalyst/worlds/src/core/auth.rs:23-24`). Every other permission route passes `&[]`
  (`verify_signer`, `services/catalyst/worlds/src/core/permissions.rs:175-186`). The statuses and bodies
  match (WP-01).
- **Owner check.** Upstream `checkOwnership` asks `namePermissionChecker.checkPermission(signer, world)`, which is
  `nameOwnership.findOwners` (`src/adapters/dcl-name-checker.ts:9-17`). A refusal is
  `401 Your wallet does not own "<world>", you can not set access control lists for it.`
  (`permissions-handlers.ts:41-48`). dcl-one's `owner_decision` asks `Policy::is_owner` and answers the same
  401 text (`permissions.rs:152-173`). An authority that cannot answer is a 503 here, where upstream answers
  500 (WP-12).
- **Writes switch (dcl-one only).** With `WORLDS_WRITES_ENABLED` off (the default), every `POST`/`PUT`/`DELETE`
  on these routes answers `503 {"ok":false,"error":"Service Unavailable","message":…}` with `Retry-After: 3600`.
  The one exception is `POST .../permissions/:permission_name/parcels`, which is a read
  (`services/catalyst/worlds/src/writes.rs:33-53`). It is a deployment switch; see "dcl-one-only routes and
  behaviour".
- **CORS, NUL guard, 30 s timeout.** dcl-one wraps these routes in `cors_middleware`, `nul_guard_middleware`
  and a 30 s `request_timeout` (408 `request timed out`) (`core/mod.rs:588-605,710-718`). CORS belongs
  to the shared-HTTP area, and none of these is specific to permissions.
- **Invalid world names** answer `400 Invalid world name: …` on every route here
  (`permissions.rs:68-70`), after the signed fetch on the signed routes. Upstream has no such check. This
  is intended (worlds-compatibility.md "Invalid world names").

## Endpoint inventory

| # | method | upstream path (upstream `routes.ts`) | dcl-one handler (`worlds/src/core/permissions.rs`) | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | GET | `/world/:world_name/permissions` (`:255`) | `get_permissions` | MATCH |
| 2 | POST | `/world/:world_name/permissions/:permission_name` (`:256-260`, legacy-payload instance) | `post_permissions` `:242` | DIVERGENT |

Counts: 10 endpoints. MATCH 2, GAP 0, DIVERGENT 8, MISSING 0. Every route exists in dcl-one at the same method
and path, on both mounts. On the success path, each route answers the upstream status and body shape.
Routes 1 and 3, two of the three unsigned routes (1, 3 and 6), differ only where
`docs/worlds-compatibility.md` says so. The seven signed routes (six strict, one legacy) share the
signed-fetch error bodies (WP-01), and the three parcel routes the schema-validator bodies (WP-02). Each DIVERGENT route keeps at least one intended difference.

---

## 1. GET /world/:world_name/permissions

Upstream: `permissions-handlers.ts:50-107`. It reads three things in parallel:

- `access.getAccessForWorld`: the stored JSONB access, or `{type:"unrestricted"}` when the world has no row or
  the name is deny-listed (`access/component.ts:34-40`, `worlds-manager.ts:322-356`);
- `permissionsManager.getOwner`: the stored `worlds.owner` first, then `nameOwnership`; a lookup failure gives
  `undefined` (`permissions-manager.ts:18-32`);
- `permissions.getPermissionsSummary` (`permissions/component.ts:422-440`).

dcl-one: `permissions.rs:75-127`. It reads `store::get_world`, `store::permission_records`
(`store.rs:466-490`) and `Policy::current_owner`, which is the live holder.

| trigger | status | body | upstream | dcl-one | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| World with grants | 200 | `{"permissions":{"deployment":{"type":"allow-list","wallets":[…]},"streaming":{"type":"allow-list","wallets":[…]},"access":{…}},"owner":"0x…","summary":{"0x…":[{"permission":"deployment","world_wide":true}]}}` | `:89-106` | `:112-126` | MATCH on the shape. `streaming.type` is always `allow-list` in both, even when streaming is unrestricted (no rows). A parcel-scoped deployer is listed in `deployment.wallets` in both (test "both world-wide and parcel-based deployers"). |
| `summary` entry | | `parcel_count` only when not world-wide | `permissions/component.ts:432-436`, handler `:82-86` | `:101-109` (`skip_serializing_if`) | MATCH. Key order: upstream follows the row order of an unordered `GROUP BY`; dcl-one sorts by address (`BTreeMap`, `ORDER BY wp.address, wp.permission`). Upstream defines no order. |
| Access `shared-secret` | 200 | `access: {"type":"shared-secret"}`, no `secret` | `removeSecrets` `:33-39` | `AccessSetting::to_public_json` `store.rs:65-77` | MATCH (tests "access settings without the secret") |
| Access `nft-ownership` | 200 | `{"type":"nft-ownership","nft":"…"}` | stored JSONB | `store.rs:68` | MATCH |
| Access `allow-list` | 200 | `{"type":"allow-list","wallets":[…],"communities":[…]}` | the JSONB as posted: case, order and duplicates kept (`access/component.ts:84-88`); PUT adds lowercased | wallets lowercased, deduplicated and ordered by `created_at, address`; communities as lowercase UUIDs | intended (worlds-compatibility.md "Allow-list documents", WP-05) |
| World unknown, NAME has a holder | 200 | defaults, `owner` the holder | `getOwner` → `nameOwnership` | `current_owner` | MATCH (test `permissions_owner_falls_back_to_the_name_holder`, `tests.rs:5666`) |
| World unknown, no holder | 200 | `owner` absent | `owner: undefined` is dropped by `JSON.stringify` | `PermissionsResponse::owner` `skip_serializing_if` | MATCH (WP-03; test `permissions_owner_falls_back_to_the_name_holder`) |
| Owner lookup fails | upstream 200 with `owner` absent; dcl-one 503 | | `permissions-manager.ts:25-31` | `current_owner` `?` (`permissions.rs:87`; test `permissions_answer_503_while_the_owner_is_undetermined`, `tests.rs:5687`) | DIVERGENT: intended (worlds-compatibility.md "Owner admission") |
| World with a stored owner whose NAME was sold | 200 | upstream: the **stored** owner; dcl-one: the live holder | `getOwner` reads `metadata.owner` first | `current_owner` | DIVERGENT: intended (same entry) |
| Invalid world name | upstream 200 defaults; dcl-one 400 | | none | `parse_world` | intended (worlds-compatibility.md "Invalid world names") |
| Deny-listed name | 200; access read as `unrestricted` when `getRawWorldRecords` filters the record out, summary still listed | | `worlds-manager.ts:344-349`: `name != ALL(<entries without .eth/.dcl>)`, which only leaves out a bare name equal to a stripped entry | `store::raw_records_exclude` | MATCH (WP-11; test `deleting_an_address_grant_requires_a_valid_world`) |

## 2. POST /world/:world_name/permissions/:permission_name

Upstream: `permissions-handlers.ts:111-170`, behind the legacy-payload instance. Stage order:

1. signed fetch;
2. `checkOwnership`;
3. a switch on `permission_name`.

The logic is in `permissions/component.ts:224-313` (deployment, streaming) and `access/component.ts:52-133` (access).

dcl-one: `permissions.rs:242-326`. Stage order:

1. signed fetch with the six keys;
2. world name;
3. `owner_decision`;
4. the switch.

### Request

The metadata is the signed `x-identity-metadata` header; there is no body.

| field | upstream | dcl-one |
|---|---|---|
| `type` | Read as is. A missing `type` reads as `undefined`. | `meta.get("type").as_str()`, else `""` (`:236,256,319`). |
| `wallets` (deployment, streaming) | `authMetadata.wallets \|\| []`, lowercased, **not validated**. A non-string element throws a `TypeError`, which becomes a 500 (`permissions/component.ts:246,299`). | Only the string elements are read, and each must be an address, else `400 Invalid address: <w>.` (`:300-316`). |
| `wallets`, `communities` (access allow-list) | Stored as given. Only the lengths are checked against `ACCESS_MAX_WALLETS` (1000) and `ACCESS_MAX_COMMUNITIES` (50), which come from env (`access/component.ts:24-25,61-71`). | Each wallet must be an address and each community a UUID. The lengths are checked against `ACCESS_MAX_COMMUNITIES` then `ACCESS_MAX_WALLETS` (`access_from_metadata`, `:399-412`; `config/src/worlds.rs:134-150`, defaults 50 and 1000) (WP-09). |
| `nft` | Any truthy value. | Must be a string (`:323-325`). |
| `secret` | Any truthy value, hashed with bcrypt cost 10. A non-string truthy value makes `hashSync` throw, which becomes a 500. | Must be a non-empty string, hashed with bcrypt `DEFAULT_COST` (12) (`:330-341`). |

### Side effects

| effect | upstream | dcl-one | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| Deployment/streaming replace | Two passes, not atomic: revoke the wallets no longer listed, grant the new ones. Rows already listed keep their parcel scoping. Unrestricted streaming deletes every streaming row (`permissions/component.ts:224-313`). | One statement (`store.rs:1182-1220`) with the same set semantics. | MATCH |
| Grant/revoke notifications | SNS `WORLDS_PERMISSION_GRANTED`/`REVOKED`, one per added or removed address. The description names the world; the URL is `${BUILDER_URL}/worlds?tab=dcl` (`permissions/component.ts:23-85`). | Inbox and email rows in the same transaction, at most 50 per direction. The description leaves the world out; the URL comes from the notices config (`permissions.rs:184-211`, `notices.rs:78-125`; test `permission_edits_notify_each_address_actually_changed`, `tests.rs:6593`). | DIVERGENT: intended (worlds-compatibility.md "Notifications") |
| `WORLD_SETTINGS_CHANGED` event on `access` | SNS `{type:"world", subType:"world-settings-changed", key:"<world>-<ts>", metadata:{worldName, accessType}}` after every successful `setAccess` (`access/component.ts:121-132`) | none | intended (worlds-compatibility.md "No settings events", WP-13) |
| Kicks after an access change | `handleAccessChange(prev, next)` (`access-change-handler/component.ts:118-187`). The first matching rule wins: (1) next is `unrestricted`: no kick. (2) The type changed, or the secret hash changed (a re-posted password always gets a new hash): kick every participant except the owner and the deployment-grant holders. (3) The allow-list wallets or communities changed: kick the non-privileged participants that `checkAccess` now refuses; one whose check fails is kept. (4) Otherwise no kick. Kicks run in batches of `ACCESS_KICK_BATCH_SIZE` (20), and failures are logged. | `Revocation::AccessSetting` re-decides every admission in the world's live rooms on a spawned task (`permissions.rs:285-289`, `core/mod.rs:361-367`, `comms/src/gatekeeper/revocation.rs:59-74`). The owner and every deployment **or streaming** grant holder stay. A switch to an allow-list keeps participants already on it. A shared-secret admission is void until the new secret is presented. | DIVERGENT: intended (worlds-compatibility.md "Kicks on access change"). Depends on the comms area (WP-14). |

3. pagination;
4. `getAddressesForParcelPermission` (`permissions-manager.ts:404-453`), which matches world-wide holders or a
   parcel in `ANY($parcels)`, ordered by address. The **raw** parcels are used, not canonicalized.

3. owner;
4. `addCommunityToAccessAllowList`: membership first, then the row lock and the allow-list check, then the cap

No kick follows, since adding cannot revoke. Upstream registers the route before
`:permission_name/:address` (`routes.ts:290-301`).

## 10. DELETE /world/:world_name/permissions/:permission_name/:address

Upstream: `permissions-handlers.ts:403-450`. Stage order:

1. strict signed fetch;
2. address;
3. permission, with the message naming three permissions;
4. owner;
5. `worlds.isWorldValid`, else `404 World "<w>" not found.`;
6. deployment/streaming: `revokePermission`, which deletes the grant (cascading to its parcels) and notifies a
   real removal;
7. access: `removeWalletFromAccessAllowList` + `handleAccessChange`.

`isWorldValid` passes when the `worlds` row exists, the name is not deny-listed, and the owner is not blocked past
the two-day grace (`logic/worlds/component.ts:68-81`, `worlds-manager.ts:322-356`). It does **not** require a
deployed scene, even though the comment above it says it does.

dcl-one: `delete_permissions_address`. `store::world_is_valid` requires the row, that `getRawWorldRecords`'s
deny-list filter keeps it (`store::raw_records_exclude`), and no operator disable or quota block past the grace.

## Explorer and client expectations

- **creator-hub** (decentraland-crypto-fetch 2.0.1) signs the folded payload on route 2 with
  `{type, secret}` or `{type, wallets, communities}` and no `signer`. The fallback and the declared keys match,
  so its password and allow-list dialogs get 204 here. Its other permission calls send no metadata and sign the
  6.x payload. An upper-case community id comes back lower-cased on the next `GET` (WP-05); its membership check
  passes when the community exists in this node's `social` schema.
- **Builder / CLI** use the 6.x payload on every route. Their error toasts read `message`, which on the
  signed-fetch refusals carries the ADR-44 line in both trees (WP-01).
- **Explorers** do not call these routes. They see the kicks (comms area).

## Backlog (WP-)

1. **WP-01 · all seven signed routes · signed-fetch refusal bodies.** Status: MATCH, no work.
   - Upstream: `{"error": <middleware message>, "message": "This endpoint requires a signed fetch request. See ADR-44."}`.
     The middleware messages are `Invalid Auth Chain`, `Invalid signature: <detail>`,
     `Expired signature: signature timestamp: …`, `Invalid metadata content: {…}` and
     `Invalid chain metadata: expected "<k>", got "<K>"`. A 5xx keeps `err.message`
     (`decentraland/worlds-content-server:src/controllers/routes.ts:89-92`; `@dcl/crypto-middleware@6.3.0`
     `dist/verify.js:69-93,161-205,285-312,331-333`).
     Pinned by `post-permissions.spec.ts:355-365,393-402`, `post-permissions-legacy-payload.spec.ts` and
     `explorer-legacy-payload.spec.ts:116-171`.
   - dcl-one: `map_auth_error_api` (`services/catalyst/comms/src/signed_fetch.rs:342`) answers
     `{error: <crypto-middleware 6.3.0 text>, message: <ADR-44 line>}` at the upstream status (worlds-comms.md
     WC-01). Pinned by the `worlds/src/core/auth.rs` tests (the key guard's `expected "<k>", got "<K>"`, the scene
     gate) and `worlds/src/core/tests.rs` `signed_routes_refuse_with_the_crypto_middleware_body`. The reason after
     `Invalid signature: ` is this node's verifier's (worlds-compatibility.md "Signed-fetch refusals").
   - Severity: none (closed).

2. **WP-02 · routes 4, 5, 6 · schema-validator bodies.** Status: MATCH, no work.
   - Upstream: `@dcl/schema-validator-component@1.0.1`:
     - a wrong content type: `415 {"ok":false,"message":"Content-Type must be application/json"}`;
     - unparsable JSON: `400 {"ok":false,"message":<JSON.parse message>}`;
     - a schema failure: `400 {"ok":false,"message":"Invalid JSON body","data":[ajv errors]}`.
   - dcl-one: `parcels_body` (`services/catalyst/worlds/src/core/permissions.rs:609-640`) answers the 415, the
     parse error through `content::validation::json_parse_message` (V8's text for the captured failures, serde's
     otherwise; `content/src/validation.rs:98-100`), and AJV 8's first error for `permissionParcelsSchema`
     (`parcels_schema_error`, `permissions.rs:645-660`, over `content::validation::array_property_error` and
     `object_keys_in_order`), written in the validator's key order by `ordered_refusal_json`. Pinned by the unit
     `parcels_body_matches_the_upstream_schema` (expected answers produced by running AJV 8 on the schema) and the
     test `parcel_bodies_are_schema_validated_on_every_parcel_route`. `Malformed` parcels (past i32) answer
     `Invalid parcels: …` (WP-10).
   - Severity: none (closed).

3. **WP-03 · route 1 · `owner` with no holder.** Status: MATCH, no work.
   - Upstream: the key is absent (`permissions-handlers.ts:103`; `get-permissions.spec.ts:82-85,97-100` expect
     `toBeUndefined()`).
   - dcl-one: `PermissionsResponse::owner` is `skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none"` (`permissions.rs:62`);
     the ts export is `owner?: string` and the sites schema `.nullish()`. Pinned by the test
     `permissions_owner_falls_back_to_the_name_holder`.
   - Severity: none (closed).

4. **WP-04 · route 2 · access `type` missing or not a string.** Status: MATCH, no work.
   - Upstream: `Invalid access type: undefined.`, or `String(type)` for a number or boolean
     (`access/component.ts:112-114`; pinned by `post-permissions.spec.ts:124-138`).
   - dcl-one: `js_string` (`permissions.rs:348`) prints the value as JS does: missing is `undefined`, an array
     joins with `,`, an object is `[object Object]`. Pinned by the unit
     `an_invalid_access_type_prints_as_javascript_does`.
   - Severity: none (closed).

5. **WP-05 · routes 1, 2, 7, 9 · the allow-list document is normalized.** Status: intended (worlds-compatibility.md).
   - Upstream: `POST .../access` stores `wallets` and `communities` as sent (case, order, duplicates).
     `GET .../permissions` returns them as stored (`access/component.ts:84-88`). An upper-case community id
     survives (`post-permissions-legacy-payload.spec.ts:108-113`).
   - dcl-one: the wallets are parsed to lowercase addresses and deduplicated, the communities stored as `uuid`
     (the schema CHECKs need both). GET returns lowercase wallets ordered by `created_at, address` and lowercase
     UUIDs (`store::AccessSetting::to_public_json`, `store.rs:79`). worlds-compatibility.md "Allow-list
     documents".
   - Severity: none (closed).

6. **WP-06 · routes 3, 5 · grant-not-found messages.** Status: MATCH, no work.
   - Upstream: route 3: 404 `Address <address as sent> does not have <p> permission for world <world>.`.
     Route 5: 400 `Permission not found. Address <address as sent> does not have <p> permission for world <world>.`

     `delete-parcels.spec.ts:137-151`).
   - dcl-one: the same texts, echoing the path address as sent (`get_allowed_parcels_for_permission`,
     `delete_permission_parcels`). Pinned by the test `a_missing_parcel_grant_names_the_address_as_sent`.
   - Severity: none (closed).

7. **WP-07 · routes 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10 · the signature is checked first.** Status: MATCH, no work.
   - Upstream: the signed-fetch middleware, then the schema validator, run before the handler, so an unsigned or
     badly signed request with a bad body, address, permission or community id answers the signature error first
     (`routes.ts:256-314`). Upstream does not validate the world name.
   - dcl-one: each handler calls the signed fetch first (`verify_signer`, `permissions.rs:175-186`; route 2 calls
     `require_verified` with `PERMISSIONS_METADATA_KEYS`, `permissions.rs:249-258`), then the body, path, world
     name and owner. Pinned by the tests `owner_gated_permission_routes_check_the_signature_first` and
     `posting_a_permission_checks_the_signature_before_the_world_name`.
   - Severity: none (closed).

8. **WP-08 · route 6 · non-canonical query parcels.** Status: intended (worlds-compatibility.md).
   - Upstream: the query parcels go to SQL raw, so `00,00` never matches the canonical stored `0,0`
     (`permissions-manager.ts:404-426`).
   - dcl-one: canonicalized, so they match (`store::addresses_for_parcel_permission`, `store.rs:1490`).
     worlds-compatibility.md "Parcel holder lookups".
   - Severity: none (closed).

9. **WP-09 · route 2 and the allow-list edits · caps and check order.** Status: MATCH, no work.
   - Upstream: `ACCESS_MAX_WALLETS` and `ACCESS_MAX_COMMUNITIES` come from config (defaults 1000 and 50).
     `setAccess` checks communities before wallets (`access/component.ts:24-25,61-71`).
   - dcl-one: the same names in `catalyst-config` (`services/catalyst/config/src/worlds.rs:134-150`, defaults 1000
     and 50, ranges 1..=10,000 and 1..=1,000) reach `Settings::with_access_caps` (`src/serve.rs:1776`,
     `worlds/src/core/mod.rs:169`). `access_from_metadata` checks communities first (`permissions.rs:399-412`);
     the single-item PUTs check `count >= cap` under the row lock (`store::modify_allow_list_access`,
     `store.rs:1609`). Pinned by the unit `allow_list_caps_come_from_settings_communities_first`, the test
     `access_allow_list_caps_from_settings_bound_every_route` (caps of 1 and 1 on POST and both PUTs) and the
     config test `access_allow_list_caps_keep_the_upstream_defaults_within_a_range`. The ranges are this node's
     (worlds-compatibility.md "Allow-list caps").
   - Severity: none (closed).

10. **WP-10 · routes 2, 3–10 · input checks.** Status: intended (worlds-compatibility.md).
    - Upstream:
      - deployment, streaming and access wallets are not validated (stored lowercased or as sent);
      - `nft` is any truthy value;
      - a non-string `secret` is a 500;
      - parcels are pattern-only, so `99999999999,0` is stored;
      - a path `:address` must match `^0x[a-fA-F0-9]{40}$` exactly.
    - dcl-one:
      - wallets must be addresses (`400 Invalid address: <w>.`); `nft` must be a string; a non-string `secret` is
        a 400; a coordinate outside i32 is `400 Invalid parcels: …` (worlds-compatibility.md "Permission
        payloads");
      - the path address is matched as upstream (`parse_path_address`, `permissions.rs:78-85`), so a padded or
        `0X` address is refused.
    - Severity: none (closed).

11. **WP-11 · route 10 (and route 1 for the deny list) · `isWorldValid` semantics.** Status: MATCH, no work.
    - Upstream: valid when the `worlds` row exists, `getRawWorldRecords`'s deny-list filter keeps it
      (`name != ALL(<entries without .eth/.dcl>)`), and the owner is not blocked past the two-day grace. A scene is
      **not** required (`logic/worlds/component.ts:68-81`, `adapters/worlds-manager.ts:322-356`).
    - dcl-one: `store::world_is_valid` (`store.rs:454-474`; its only caller is route 10, after the owner check,
      `permissions.rs:520-565`) requires the row, applies the same filter (`store::raw_records_exclude`,
      `store.rs:442-449`) and the operator disable and quota grace. Route 1 reads a filtered-out world's access as
      the default. Pinned by the test `deleting_an_address_grant_requires_a_valid_world`: a world with no scene
      answers 204 on the `deployment` and `access` branches (the latter revokes the removed wallet), a
      deny-listed world's DELETE answers 404, a bare name 401.
    - Severity: none (closed).

12. **WP-12 · all owner-gated routes · name authority unavailable.** Status: intended (worlds-compatibility.md).
    - Upstream: `findOwners` throws, so `errorHandler` answers `500 {"error":"Internal Server Error"}`
      (`adapters/dcl-name-checker.ts:14`).
    - dcl-one: `503 {"error":"Service Unavailable","message":…}` with `Retry-After: 1` (`owner_decision`,
      `permissions.rs:159-173`). worlds-compatibility.md "Owner admission".
    - Severity: none (closed).

13. **WP-13 · route 2 (`access`) · no `WORLD_SETTINGS_CHANGED` event.** Status: intended (worlds-compatibility.md).
    - Upstream: after every successful `setAccess`, SNS publishes
      `{type:"world", subType:"world-settings-changed", key:"<world>-<ts>", timestamp, metadata:{worldName, accessType}}`
      (`access/component.ts:121-132`).
    - dcl-one: no event. In-tree readers read `worlds.worlds.access_type`; `queue_access_recheck` covers comms.
      worlds-compatibility.md "No settings events".
    - Severity: none (closed).

14. **WP-14 · routes 2, 8, 10 · who is kicked after an access change.** Status: intended (worlds-compatibility.md).
    - Upstream: the first matching rule decides (`access-change-handler/component.ts:118-187`):
      - next `unrestricted`: no kick;
      - the type changed, or the secret hash changed: kick everyone but the owner and the deployment holders;
      - the allow-list changed: kick whoever `checkAccess` refuses, keeping anyone whose check failed.

      The kicks go through `participantKicker` in batches of 20, and errors are logged.
    - dcl-one: `Revocation::AccessSetting` / `Address` (`worlds/src/core/mod.rs:211`, `revoke_unless_admitted`
      `:383`) hands the edit to the gatekeeper, which re-decides each live admission
      (`comms/src/gatekeeper/revocation.rs`). The owner and every deployment **or streaming** holder stay; a switch
      to an allow-list keeps anyone already listed; an undecidable participant stays. A same-type re-post also
      re-decides. worlds-compatibility.md "Kicks on access change"; the room-level behaviour is in the comms area.
    - Severity: none (closed).

15. **WP-15 · route tree · paths between the static `access` and `{permission_name}` routes.** Status: MATCH, no work.
    - Upstream: `POST /world/w/permissions/access/parcels` reaches route 6 (400 `does not support allow-list`,
      pinned by `get-addresses-for-parcel-permission.spec.ts:51-62`). `PUT /world/w/permissions/deployment/parcels`
      and `PUT /world/w/permissions/access/communities` reach route 9 (400 `Invalid address: parcels.` /
      `… communities.`).
    - dcl-one: matchit backtracks from `access/communities/{id}` for `access/parcels` and `access/communities`;
      `{permission_name}/parcels` hands PUT and DELETE to routes 9 and 10 with the address `parcels`
      (`put_permissions_parcels_address`, `permissions.rs:825-845`; routes `worlds/src/core/mod.rs:673-679`).
      Pinned by the test `permission_paths_between_the_static_and_named_routes_route_like_upstream`.
    - Severity: none (closed).

16. **WP-16 · route 2 · bcrypt cost.** Status: intended (worlds-compatibility.md).
    - Upstream: cost 10 (`access/constants.ts:15`; `post-permissions.spec.ts:84` reads `$2b$10$` from the stored
      value, which is not on the wire).
    - dcl-one: `bcrypt::DEFAULT_COST` (12) (`permissions.rs:392`). Hashes from either tree verify on the other.
      worlds-compatibility.md "Shared-secret hashes".
    - Severity: none (closed).

17. **WP-17 · routes 2, 4, 5, 9, 10 · notification transport and text.** Status: intended (worlds-compatibility.md).
    - Upstream: SNS `WORLDS_PERMISSION_GRANTED`/`REVOKED`, one per changed address; the description names the world;
      `url: ${BUILDER_URL}/worlds?tab=dcl` (`permissions/component.ts:23-85`).
    - dcl-one: inbox and email rows in the edit transaction, at most 50 per direction, with no world in the
      description; removing a grant's last parcel sends a revoke (`commit_with_notices`, `permissions.rs:212`;
      `notices.rs:78`). worlds-compatibility.md "Delivery", "Last parcel removed".
    - Severity: none (closed).

18. **WP-18 · route 5 · removing the last parcel.** Status: intended (worlds-compatibility.md).
    - Upstream: keeps the row, which becomes world-wide (`delete-parcels.spec.ts:86-126`).
    - dcl-one: deletes the grant (`store::remove_parcels_from_permission`, `store.rs:1350`), so a scoped deployer is
      never widened to the whole world; route 3 then answers 404 where upstream answers
      `{"total":0,"parcels":[]}`. worlds-compatibility.md "Removing a grant's last parcel".
    - Severity: none (closed).

19. **WP-19 · routes 1–10 · community ids must be UUIDs; owner is the live holder; invalid world names 400.**
    Status: intended (worlds-compatibility.md).
    - These are the worlds-compatibility.md entries "Community ids", "Owner admission" and "Invalid world names".
      None breaks a Decentraland client: the social service issues UUID community ids, and world names come from
      NAMEs.
    - Severity: none (closed).

## Endpoints dcl-one serves in this area that upstream does not

No extra routes. Behaviour on the same routes that upstream lacks:

- **`WORLDS_WRITES_ENABLED` off (the default):** every permission edit answers
  `503 {"ok":false,"error":"Service Unavailable","message":"worlds writes are disabled on this node …"}` with
  `Retry-After: 3600`. `GET .../permissions`, `GET .../address/:a/parcels` and `POST .../:p/parcels` stay open
  (`services/catalyst/worlds/src/writes.rs:33-53`). A node meant as a drop-in replacement must turn it on.
- **408 `request timed out`** after 30 s on every permission route (`core/mod.rs:710-718`).
- **The persisted access recheck:** every access write queues `social.world_access_rechecks`
  (`store.rs:1573,1655`), so a kick that a LiveKit outage blocked is retried. Upstream's kick is fire-and-forget.
- **The operator disable** (`/admin/worlds/{name}/disable`) makes route 10 answer 404 (`store::world_is_valid`).
