-- Catalyst v2: the operator plane and the remaining services: credits (the
-- Marketplace Credits ledger, Stripe purchases, carts, checkouts and
-- authorizations) and ops (the ONE operator audit).
--
-- Designed from the workload, not copied: the old crates' databases
-- (`credits`, the server's own) collapse into two schemas of `catalyst`.
-- Sources: catalyrst-credits/migrations 0001..0021, the old server's
-- admin_audit (catalyrst-server/src/admin/audit.rs).
--
-- Conventions, as in the other files: wallet addresses are lowercase 0x + 40
-- hex text where this node writes them (CHECKed); every timestamp is
-- `timestamp without time zone` holding UTC (the pool pins TimeZone=UTC; the
-- old tables were timestamptz); the current time is a bind parameter in
-- every due, expiry, window and purge predicate, never in an index
-- predicate; credits amounts are numeric (never a float in SQL or Rust), wei
-- is numeric(78,0). No FK crosses a schema: `credits.ledger.admin_audit_id`
-- names an `ops.admin_audit` row and `credits.fulfillment_outbox.external_ref`
-- an economy broker purchase, reconciled on read.
--
-- Authority: the credits ledger, checkouts, authorizations and the operator
-- audit are LOCAL authority behind OPS_WRITES_ENABLED (default false; 503
-- envelope like src/social/writes.rs). The former `telemetry` schema (the
-- Sentry/Segment sink and its console) is retired: a database stamped before
-- the removal drops it through schemas/releases/telemetry-retired.sql;
-- client telemetry goes to Segment.
--
-- Domain agents append ONLY inside the `-- ==== section: ... ====` blocks at
-- the end, after re-reading this file.

-- console or the admin bearers (sync pause/resume/force, cache flush,
-- credits grant/revoke/refund/block/packs, rpc method and upstream edits,
-- ...), append-only: the application only ever INSERTs, in the same transaction
-- as the write it records where the write is SQL. `actor` is the
-- authenticated identity (a console wallet, `token:<name>` for a bearer,
-- `loopback`); `domain` + `action` the verb (`content.sync.pause`,
-- `credits.grant`), `target` the row or key acted on (a wallet, a checkout
-- id, an rpc method), `detail` the request as received (never a secret),
-- `result` the outcome. The old per-service audit tables (telemetry
-- admin_audit, credits admin_audit, the server's content admin_audit) were
-- the same fact under three shapes; the CHECK keeps the `telemetry` domain
-- for the rows the retired sink console wrote.
